# Ads engine

Mesi enables creators to set up three types of ads:

1. **Content** - Ads are displayed when users open specific content.
2. **Gallery**  - Ads appear when a user's creator profile is accessed.
3. **In-Content** - Currently available for Music and Podcasts (and planned for videos once longer uploads are supported). These ads play during content consumption, such as listening to audio or watching videos in the future.

Mesi Ads engine is similar to Google AdSense and helps creators earn extra income.

## Ads Parametrization

Creators can adjust the frequency and length of the ads that their fans are exposed to:&#x20;

#### For Content and Gallery ads:

* A 1:1 setting means an ad shows **every time** the content/gallery is opened.
* A 1:2 setting means an ad shows **every other time**
* A 2:1 setting means **two ads show every time**&#x20;
* A 1:5 setting means **an ad shows once every five times**

#### For Content ads:

* **Max length** - allowing to limit the maximum time fans are disrupted with a single ad.
* **Max count** - the maximum amount of ads that can be played per content. **Min distance** - minimum time distance between one add and another.

The settings can’t conflict with each other.&#x20;

**Note**: to preserve a high-quality user experience, the total max length of the advertisement material (max length x max count) can’t exceed **15% of the content length**.

These rules are built into the NFT and can only be modified as long as the creator keeps ownership. Once the NFT is sold, the ad settings remain locked unless the NFT is repurchased by the original creator.

## Ways to Earn Money

Creators can earn from ads in three ways:

1. **Royalty Model:** The creator always keeps the money from the ads, even if they sell the NFT.
2. **Ownership Model:** The person who owns the NFT at the time gets all the ad money.
3. **Hybrid Model:** The ad money is split between the creator and the NFT owner based on a policy defined by the creator and built into the NFT.

## Why Ads settings matter

If an NFT is listed for sale, users can view its estimated value.

* Additional earnings from ads - as long as it is distributed to NFT owners (whether through full ownership or the hybrid model) will increase its value.
* However, content overloaded with ads may lose value due to reduced interest in fully interacting with it.
* It is up to the creator to find a balance between increasing value through shared profits and decreased value from ads' interference with the content.&#x20;

**Example 1**: Sarah, a creator, decided to run ads every 10 seconds in her videos. While she earned all the profits, her viewers found the constant ads frustrating and often stopped watching. This also discouraged them from engaging with Sarah's other content. As a result, the value of her NFTs and her entire gallery dropped due to reduced viewer interest.

**Example 2**: Mike, another creator, decided to show one ad every five views of his video content, with ads taking up only 2% of the total video time. This balanced approach kept viewers' engagement unaffected, and the interaction rate with his content remained high. Additionally, Mike shared the entire ad revenue with the current NFT owner.  Ad revenue from this NFT turned out to be decent, hence as a result, the value of that NFT significantly increased.&#x20;
