## Strategic Collaborations

You can scale your brand by leveraging two distinct types of promotion partners:

### Internal Affiliates
These are existing Mesi users, such as fans or other creators. 
* **Benefit:** They are already familiar with the ecosystem and can promote your content directly within Mesi communities.
* **Incentive:** Often rewarded with $MESI tokens or "Fan Level" boosts.

### External Affiliates
Partners recruited from outside the platform who operate on global networks like Google Ads, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, or TikTok.
* **Benefit:** Directs fresh traffic and new users into the Mesi ecosystem through your personalized links.
* **Tracking:** Uses whitelisted **API endpoints** to ensure external conversion data is accurately synced with your Mesi dashboard.

## Affiliate Safeguards

To ensure high-quality traffic and protect the platform's integrity, Mesi implements a strict collateral system for all promotion partners.



<Warning>
  **Token Collateral Requirement:** Affiliates are required to lock **$MESI tokens** as collateral before launching ad promotions. If an affiliate violates platform advertising rules (e.g., spamming or fraudulent clicks), penalties are deducted directly from their locked collateral.
</Warning>

### Developer Integration
For professional agencies and external networks, Mesi offers whitelisted **API endpoints**. This allows for deep integration with third-party tracking software and automated marketing stacks, ensuring your external affiliate data is as robust as your internal metrics.
