## Internal and External Affiliate Collaboration

**Internal affiliates**

Other users within the Mesi platform, including fans or smaller creators.

**External affiliates**

Anyone outside the platform is recruited via personalized affiliate links or codes. These affiliates may operate on platforms like Google Ads, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, or TikTok.
