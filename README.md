The content creation and online influencer industry has experienced exponential growth in recent years, fueled by the rise of subscription fan platforms, social media influencer platforms, and user-generated content.  Traditional platforms in the space are run based on a top-down corporate model and often fall short of meeting the needs of creators and consumers alike. This leads to creators suffering from a lack of control over their content, limited monetization options, and a disconnect from their audience.

Consumers, on the other hand, are often overwhelmed with excessive advertising, a lack of personalized and community experiences, and a fragmented content landscape. This results in limited transparency, unequal distribution of earnings, and a lack of community involvement in shaping the platform's future. **Mesi is on a mission to change that.**
