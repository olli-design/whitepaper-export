The **$MESI token** is the transactional backbone of the Mesi ecosystem. It enables instant settlements, powers platform gamification, and secures the Creator Chain. 

While the Web App serves as the primary hub for $MESI utility, the Mobile App bridges the gap by facilitating fiat-to-token interactions to remain compliant with global app store regulations.
