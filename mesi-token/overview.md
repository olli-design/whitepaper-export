# Overview

The MESI token serves as the backbone of transactions and interactions on the platform, particularly on the web app. Its role includes payment processing, instant settlement with creators, rewards, governance, and gamification.&#x20;

While the web app fully integrates MESI token functionality, the mobile app focuses more on fiat transactions due to App Store restrictions that require pricing and payments in fiat currency.

## Token launch

The MESI token will be distributed in two stages:

#### 1st Distribution

* To be performed on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token.
* Distribution exclusively to early investors.
* Trading pairs will be created and supported only on Ethereum, with no support for other blockchains.

#### 2nd Distribution

* To be performed on the Creator Chain (see [Technology and Backend](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j_1_GBLX02jDs8hRfUU0CSNB2oRfbSaex3oWP9c5-O0/edit?tab=t.2iee0x5wzl78)).
* Distribution to public investors and all other entitled parties.&#x20;
* Trading pairs will be created and supported on the Creator Chain with continued support to Ethereum trading pairs.

## Token Bridge

An Ethereum ↔ Creator Chain bridge will be launched alongside the second token distribution.

* **Token Migration**: Ethereum token holders will be encouraged to transfer their tokens to the Creator Chain.
* **Liquidity Concentration**: Over time, MESI will facilitate the migration of tokens from Ethereum (and other chains if they will be supported mid-through) back to the Creator Chain, aiming to consolidate token liquidity depth (see [Economy of MESI](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j_1_GBLX02jDs8hRfUU0CSNB2oRfbSaex3oWP9c5-O0/edit?tab=t.tugnfp1ky1jk)).
