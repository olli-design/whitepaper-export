# Decentralization

## Overview

Mesi is a centrally managed platform, operating without decentralized governance or a DAO. However, users of the Mesi App are encouraged to participate in shaping the platform by submitting proposals for the Mesi App team to review. These proposals can include suggestions for platform improvements, new features, or reporting detected bugs.

## Proposal Rewards

If your idea gets approved, you could earn a thank-you reward. The Mesi Team decides how much to give based on what they think is fair and how it fits their plans for the platform.

## Submission Limits

The number of proposals you can submit per month depends on your account tier:

* **Tiers 1-3**: One proposal per month.
* **Tiers 4-6**: Two proposals per month.
* **Tiers 7-9**: Three proposals per month.
* **Tier 10**: Five proposals per month.
