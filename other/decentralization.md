description: "How the Mesi community influences platform evolution through the tiered proposal system."
---

While Mesi currently operates under a centrally managed model to ensure rapid development and ecosystem stability, we prioritize a community-driven feedback loop. We believe that the best platform improvements come directly from the creators and fans who use the **\$MESI** ecosystem daily.



## The Proposal Framework

Mesi does not utilize a DAO or decentralized governance at this stage. Instead, we employ a **Structured Proposal System**. Users are encouraged to submit formal suggestions to help shape the platform's trajectory.

### What You Can Propose
* **Feature Requests:** New tools for creators, fans, or advertisers.
* **UI/UX Improvements:** Enhancements to the mobile or web application interface.
* **Technical Optimization:** Reporting bugs or suggesting performance upgrades.
* **Economic Adjustments:** Feedback on fees, rewards, or staking mechanics.

## Submission Limits by Account Tier

To ensure high-quality feedback and prevent system congestion, the number of monthly proposals is linked to your [Account Tier](/gamification/user-tiers-and-creator-limits).

| Account Tiers | Monthly Proposal Limit |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tiers 1 - 3** | 1 Proposal |
| **Tiers 4 - 6** | 2 Proposals |
| **Tiers 7 - 9** | 3 Proposals |
| **Tier 10 (Elite)** | 5 Proposals |

<Note>
  **Quality over Quantity:** Higher tier accounts have more influence, but all proposals undergo the same rigorous review process by the Mesi product team.
</Note>

## Reward Mechanism

Mesi values the intellectual contribution of its users. If a community proposal is approved and scheduled for implementation, the contributor may be eligible for a **Gratitude Reward**.

* **Discretionary Awards:** Rewards are issued at the sole discretion of the Mesi Team.
* **Valuation:** The reward size is determined based on the proposal's impact, technical complexity, and alignment with the long-term roadmap.
* **Distribution:** Rewards are typically settled in **\$MESI** tokens or unique platform badges/reputation boosts.
