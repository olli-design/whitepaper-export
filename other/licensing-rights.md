# Licensing rights

When you create and upload content to the Mesi App, you still own all the rights to it, even if you sell it as an NFT.

## Options for Sharing Your Content

You can send your content to Mesi Public Media Library. If it gets approved, everyone on the Mesi Platform will be able to access and reuse it. You’ll need to choose one of these options:

* **Free  License**: Anyone can use your content without paying.
* **Paid License**: You set a price and decide how the license works (e.g. for a certain amount of time, views, or forever).

If you’ve already put your content in the library, you can’t make it private again unless you remove it completely from there. However, selling the content as an NFT is still allowed.

## Revenue split

If someone buys a paid license for your content, you get 90% of the money, and Mesi takes 10%. External companies can also buy licenses for your content. Mesi handles the payment and sends you 90% of the fee.

| Removing Content from the Library   | Not possible, unless there are no NFTs reusing your content yet.                                                                     |
| Switching from Paid to Free License | You can make such a change anytime. Existing paid licenses won’t be affected, and when they expire, the content becomes free to use. |
