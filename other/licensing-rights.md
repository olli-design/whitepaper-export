At Mesi, we believe in **Creator Sovereignty**. When you upload content, you retain 100% of the underlying Intellectual Property (IP) rights, even if you sell the content as an NFT.

## Mesi Public Media Library

The Public Media Library is a central repository where creators can choose to share their assets for platform-wide reuse. By submitting content to the library, you enable other users to incorporate your work into their own creations, generating a passive revenue stream.

### Licensing Options
When submitting to the library, you must select one of the following licensing models:

* **Free License:** Grants any Mesi user the right to reuse your content within the platform at no cost.
* **Paid License:** You set a custom price and define the parameters (e.g., duration of use, view limits, or perpetual access).

## Revenue Distribution

Mesi handles the complex infrastructure of licensing and payment distribution. Whether the licensee is another Mesi user or an external corporation, the split remains transparent.



| Recipient | Allocation | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Creator** | **90%** | Settled instantly in **\$MESI** tokens. |
| **Mesi Platform** | **10%** | Infrastructure, security, and transaction processing fee. |

## Managing Library Content

Once content is contributed to the library, certain rules apply to maintain the integrity of the ecosystem and protect users who have already licensed your work.

### Modification & Removal Matrix

| Action | Availability | Condition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Remove from Library** | Restricted | Only possible if no other NFTs or users are currently reusing the content. |
| **Switch: Paid to Free** | **Allowed** | Can be changed anytime. Active paid licenses remain valid until their expiration. |
| **Switch: Free to Paid** | Restricted | Only possible if the content has not yet been reused by other platform assets. |

<Note>
  **NFT Sales:** Selling an asset as an NFT does not prevent you from also licensing it in the Public Media Library. These are two separate revenue streams for the same piece of content.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **Pro-Tip:** Start by offering a few "Free License" assets to build your reputation and "Used In" metrics. Once you have a high engagement score, transition your premium assets to "Paid Licenses."
