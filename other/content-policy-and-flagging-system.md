# Content Policy and Flagging System

## Content Rules

Mesi App does not allow:

* Illegal content.
* Content that breaks copyright laws.
* Inappropriate or unethical material.
* Content that is very low-quality or off-topic.
* Materials that goes against [Mesi Content Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F9HVcaBDUK85tAOl0c1zQncQyDNByNCU-4h2zmclA74/edit?tab=t.0)
* Any other content that is against any applicable Mesi Rules or purpose of the Platform.

## How Mesi Filters Content

Mesi uses an AI system to find and remove disallowed content. The filtering happens when:

* Content is uploaded.
* AI-generated input or prompts are submitted.

## Flagging System

Mesi manages rule-breaking content using three types of flags: **Yellow, Red**, and **Black Flags**.

#### How Flags Work

#### **Automatic Detection**

* The AI system spots content that breaks the rules (like inappropriate language or copyright problems).
* Moderators check flagged content to confirm if the rules were broken.

#### **User Reports**

* Users can report content they think breaks the rules.
* Moderators review these reports and decide if a flag is needed.

#### **Moderator Checks**

* Moderators also look at content during regular or surprise checks.
* They focus on accounts with flags or suspicious behavior.

#### Types of Flags

#### **Yellow Flags**

* Given for small rule-breaking actions (e.g., several violations in a few days).
* Getting two yellow flags (in total or one month) leads to a red flag.

#### **Red Flags**

* You get a red flag after two yellow flags.
* It can lead to extra rules for uploading content, like needing to provide more information based on file size.
* Red flags disappear over time, but getting new ones resets the timer.

#### **Black Flags**

* Given for serious rule-breaking, such as:
  * Uploading illegal content.
  * Breaking copyright laws in a way that causes big problems.
* These cases are sent to Mesi Admin for review.

#### What Happens Next:

* Your account might be permanently banned.
* Mesi will do a deep review of your account.
* Mesi may contact law enforcement if needed.

## Misusing the Report Button

If someone misuses the "report content" button often, for example:

* Reporting content they dislike just to bother someone.
* Filing reports as a joke or without any real reason.
* Repeatedly reporting the same content after it has already been reviewed and cleared by moderators.

Consequences are:&#x20;

1. Initial warning
2. If the behavior continues - suspension of the reporting feature for 1 month
