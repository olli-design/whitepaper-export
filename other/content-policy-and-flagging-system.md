## The Moderation Workflow
Mesi employs a multi-layered approach to content filtering, ensuring that violations are caught early and handled fairly.



<Steps>
  <Step title="AI Pre-Filtering">
    Our AI system scans content and prompts during the upload process. Disallowed material is blocked instantly before reaching the platform.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Community Reporting">
    Users can flag content they believe violates our rules. These reports are queued for human review.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Moderator Verification">
    Dedicated moderators perform regular audits and investigate flagged items to confirm violations and assign appropriate penalties.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The Three-Flag System
Penalties are categorized by severity using a color-coded flagging system.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Yellow Flag" icon="flag" color="#facc15">
    **Minor Violations**
    Issued for small infractions. Two Yellow Flags within a 30-day window automatically trigger a Red Flag.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Red Flag" icon="flag" color="#ef4444">
    **Escalated Status**
    Leads to account restrictions, such as mandatory manual approval for all new uploads and reduced visibility.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Black Flag" icon="flag" color="#000000">
    **Critical Violation**
    Issued for illegal content or severe copyright theft. Triggers an immediate Admin review and potential permanent ban.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Consequences of Enforcement
* **Account Suspension:** Temporary or permanent loss of platform access.
* **Reward Forfeiture:** Disqualification from [Incentive Programs](/gamification/nectar-points) and token airdrops.
* **Legal Action:** Mesi reserves the right to contact law enforcement for serious criminal violations.

## Report Integrity
To prevent harassment and maintain system efficiency, Mesi strictly monitors the use of the report feature.



<Warning>
  **Misuse of Reporting:** Filing false reports, reporting as a joke, or repeated reporting of cleared content will lead to an initial warning, followed by a **1-month suspension** of your reporting privileges.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  **Pro-Tip:** If your account receives a Red Flag, the timer resets with every subsequent violation. Consistently following guidelines is the only way to restore your account to "Good Standing."
