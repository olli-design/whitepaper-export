description: "Join the 'First on Mesi' program to stress-test our infrastructure and earn your share of the MESI airdrop."

Before the Mesi ecosystem goes live on Mainnet, we are inviting our community to participate in the **Incentivized Testnet**. This period is critical for stress-testing our smart contracts and refining the user experience of the Mesi Web App.



## Testing Scope & Activities

Participants are encouraged to interact with the platform as they would on Mainnet. Every action contributes to the stability of the final release and increases your potential rewards.

### Core Testing Pillars
* **Economy & DeFi:** Performing test transactions, holding, staking, and locking **\$MESI** test tokens.
* **NFT Infrastructure:** Testing the full lifecycle of NFT creation, listing, and trading.
* **Smart Contracts:** Interacting with decentralized protocols and claiming test rewards.
* **Network Security:** Identifying and reporting bugs, UI inconsistencies, or potential vulnerabilities.
