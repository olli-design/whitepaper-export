# Incentivized testnet

Before the public launch of the Mesi App, users will have the opportunity to participate in our **incentivized testnet and test app.**

The test app will be available on the web browser version of the Mesi App. Users will be able to create both fan and creator accounts and engage in activities that help test the app's features and the Mesi testnet blockchain.&#x20;

Testnet activities will include performing transactions, testing NFT creation and trading, interacting with smart contracts, holding, staking, and locking $MESI tokens, claiming rewards, and most importantly - reporting bugs or vulnerabilities.&#x20;

Participating in these activities and completing tasks will earn users nectar points, which can later be converted into $MESI tokens during the Mesi mainnet airdrop.
