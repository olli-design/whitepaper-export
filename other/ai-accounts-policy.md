Mesi embraces the future of AI-driven creativity while prioritizing human authenticity. To maintain the value of interactions and the integrity of the **\$MESI** economy, all users must adhere to strict disclosure and classification standards.



---

## Account Classification

Every account on Mesi must be labeled correctly at the time of creation. This transparency ensures that fans know exactly who—or what—they are interacting with before committing funds.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Real Human Accounts" icon="user" color="#3b82f6">
    **Requirement:** All messaging and content must be generated by the human operator.
    **Constraint:** No undisclosed AI agents for DMs or content creation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI-Managed Accounts" icon="robot" color="#8b5cf6">
    **Requirement:** Must be clearly labeled as "AI-Managed."
    **Benefit:** Allows for full or semi-automation using AI Pilots and Engagement Agents.

## AI Tools for Creators

Mesi provides a suite of approved tools to help creators scale, categorized by the nature of the account.

### Approved Toolsets
* **Creators & Optimizers:** Built-in platform tools designed to enhance human workflow without replacing human identity.

### Key Restrictions

## Mandatory Disclosure Flags

If any portion of an account utilizes AI, the following metadata flags must be active. Failure to disclose triggers immediate enforcement via the Black Wall.

* **Full AI:** The entire persona and content cycle are AI-driven.
* **AI Messaging:** Direct messages (DMs) are handled by an automated agent.
* **AI Content:** Feed posts or gallery items are generated or heavily modified by AI.

## The Black Wall: Anti-AI Detection

The **Black Wall** is Mesi’s proprietary security layer designed to detect undisclosed AI usage and protect the value of paid human interactions.



### Enforcement Mechanism
The Black Wall utilizes behavioral forensics to monitor compliance:
* **Pattern Analysis:** Identifying non-human response times and repetitive syntax patterns.
* **Engagement Verification:** Cross-referencing interaction data with known AI signatures.

### Penalties for Undisclosed AI
1. **Warnings:** Issued for first-time or minor detection overlaps.
2. **Flagging:** Automatic application of "AI Content" or "AI Messaging" tags to the profile.
3. **Account Seizure:** In severe cases of deception, earnings are confiscated to compensate affected fans, and the account is permanently banned.

<Warning>
  **Protecting User Trust:** Undisclosed AI use devalues the ecosystem. Mesi maintains a zero-tolerance policy for accounts that charge "Human Rates" for "AI Labor."
</Warning>

<Tip>
  **Pro-Tip:** If you are a human creator using AI for background edits or grammar checks, use the **AI Content** flag to stay compliant while maintaining your **Real Human** status.
