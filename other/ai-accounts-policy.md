# AI Accounts Policy

## Real vs. AI Accounts

Users must label their accounts as either Real Human or AI-Managed.

## Concern: Undisclosed AI Use

The undisclosed use of AI agents in managing real human accounts (e.g., AI-generated messages or responses) poses risks, including:

* Loss of user trust
* Devaluation of paid interactions
* Compromised user experience

## Policy for Real Human Accounts

Accounts labeled as Real Human must not use AI for messaging or content generation without disclosure. This policy ensures authentic interactions and maintains user trust.

The Black Wall (Anti-AI detection system) monitors compliance by identifying AI-generated patterns and behaviors.

## AI-Managed Accounts

Fully or partially AI-managed accounts are allowed but must be clearly labeled as AI-Managed. This ensures:

* Fans are aware of AI involvement
* Expectations are properly set
* Transparent payment decisions
* Accurate engagement metrics

## AI Tools for Creators

Creators using AI assistance have access to:

* **Built-in paid AI tools** (classified as Creators and Optimizers)
* **External whitelisted AI tools** for content creation (subject to approval)

#### Note:&#x20;

* **For Real Human Accounts**: AI tools cannot generate human faces or images from scratch.
* **For AI-Managed Accounts**: Full or semi-automation is allowed using AI Pilots and  Messaging/Engagement Agents​

## AI Usage Flags

Accounts utilizing AI must apply the appropriate disclosure flags:

* **Full AI** – The entire account is AI-managed
* **AI Messaging** – AI used for direct messages
* **AI Content** – AI used for content generation

## Black Wall: Anti-AI Detection

Our **Black Wall** feature safeguards against unauthorized AI usage by:

* Analyzing replies, behavioral patterns, and engagement
* Issuing warnings or bans for policy violations
* Confiscating earnings and compensating affected users in severe cases

This ensures a fair and transparent user experience across the platform.
