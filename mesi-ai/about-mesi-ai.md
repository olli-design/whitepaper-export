## Text input

## Voice recognition

Talking to Mesi AI with your voice makes using the platform faster and easier. This is especially helpful if you’re busy, like driving a car, or just find talking easier than typing. Mesi’s voice recognition stands out with:&#x20;

#### Voice recognition

* The AI understands your voice, even if there’s background noise or you have an accent.&#x20;
* It can figure out what you mean, even if you use slang or leave sentences unfinished.&#x20;
* It also supports many languages.

#### Voice shortcuts

* You can save time by creating voice shortcuts for tasks you do often.
* For example, you can give one-word commands to perform a series of actions.&#x20;
* If there’s a mistake, you can just say _“undo”_ or _“repeat”_ to fix it. If it’s unsure, it will ask questions like _“Did you mean bold or italic?”_

#### Live executions

* When you give a voice command, changes happen right away.&#x20;
* For example, you could say, “Make the header bold and red,” and it will update instantly.
* You can also use your **voice and touch together**, like tapping a section and saying, “Make this bigger.”
