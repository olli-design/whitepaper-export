Mesi AI is a versatile smart assistant integrated directly into your contacts list. You can interact with it just like a friend via text or voice to create images, videos, and music, or to manage your platform settings.

## Interaction Modes

### Text Input
Mesi AI uses advanced natural language processing to understand intent even with typos or unclear phrasing.
* **Auto-Correction:** Suggests helpful fixes for your prompts.
* **Predictive Text:** Can finish your sentences to speed up the creative process.
* **Multilingual Support:** Communicate fluently in dozens of languages.

### Voice Command Engine
Voice interaction allows for hands-free management, perfect for creators on the move. Mesi’s voice recognition is built to handle real-world conditions.

* **Robust Recognition:** Accurate performance despite background noise, accents, or slang.
* **Contextual Intelligence:** Understands unfinished sentences and nuances in speech.
* **Voice Shortcuts:** Create one-word commands to trigger complex, multi-step actions.
* **Error Correction:** Simply say *"Undo"* or *"Repeat"* to fix actions. If the AI is unsure, it will ask for clarification (e.g., *"Did you mean bold or italic?"*).

## Live Executions

Mesi AI enables **Instant Feedback**—commands are executed in real time as you speak.

* **Direct Styling:** Say "Make the header bold and red," and the update happens instantly.
* **Multimodal Interaction:** Use **voice and touch together**. For example, tap a section of your content and say, "Make this bigger."
