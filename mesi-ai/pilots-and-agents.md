## Customization & Logic

You can fine-tune your Agents using two distinct methods, depending on your technical expertise.

### 1. Prompt-Based Customization
Ideal for defining personality and general behavior. Use natural language to:
* Set behavioral guardrails and communication styles.
* Assign specific tasks or temporary "campaign modes."
* Define how the agent should react to different fan segments.

### 2. Advanced Customization (Developer Mode)
For power users and studios, Mesi supports direct logic integration via the **AI Console**.
* **Protocodes & Logic Trees:** Import custom executable instructions to handle complex decision-making.
* **Workflows & Triggers:** Define "If-This-Then-That" scenarios based on on-chain events or user interactions.
* **Database Integration:** Connect your agent to external datasets for hyper-personalized interactions.

## Connectivity & External Endpoints

Mesi is an open ecosystem. We support integration with **pre-approved external AI tools**, allowing you to extend your account's functionality.

* **Data Exchange:** Seamlessly share information between Mesi native tools and third-party AI assistants.
* **Complementary AI:** Run specialized external models (such as custom LLMs or generative art engines) that pipe their outputs directly into the Mesi infrastructure via our secure endpoints.

<Info>
  **Security Note:** All external tools must pass a verification check to ensure they comply with Mesi's safety and data privacy standards before they can be linked to a live account.
