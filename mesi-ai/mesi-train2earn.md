**Train2Earn** is Mesi’s opt-in incentivized contribution program. It allows creators and fans to participate in training the platform’s AI systems. By providing high-quality data and feedback, users earn rewards and governance-level perks within the ecosystem.

The system is built on four pillars: **Consent**, **Transparency**, **Quality Control**, and **Fairness**.

## Core Principles

| Principle | Implementation | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Informed Consent** | Granular opt-in via in-app prompts with clear data scopes. | User trust & regulatory compliance. |
| **Reward Incentives** | $MESI tokens and exclusive perks tied to contribution quality. | High-quality data & user retention. |
| **Anti-Abuse** | KYC verification, anomaly filters, and human-in-the-loop audits. | Protection against Sybil and bot attacks. |
| **Transparency** | Publicly accessible training stats and audit logs. | Platform accountability. |

## How it Works

When you opt into a campaign, Mesi AI may request your assistance with various micro-tasks:
* **Interactive Prompting:** Answering direct questions to refine AI intent.
* **Sentiment Labeling:** Rating images or indicating your current mood to train the **FeelFlow** engine.
* **Polls & Questionnaires:** Completing targeted surveys to help the AI understand niche trends.

### The Lifecycle of a Ticket



Each campaign has a limited capacity. Participants who successfully complete tasks receive a **Ticket**, which serves as a Proof-of-Participation.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Placeholder Issued">
    Upon task completion, a temporary placeholder is added to your account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Quality Validation">
    Mesi's automated filters and human auditors verify the accuracy and quality of your input.
  </Step>
  <Step title="NFT Minting">
    Validated tickets are converted into **Tradeable NFT Tickets**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reward Access">
    Use your NFT to enter reward pools or trade it on the Mesi Marketplace.

## Rewards & Marketplace

Mesi NFT Tickets unlock access to diverse prize pools. Higher-tier campaigns may offer:
* **$MESI Token Packs:** Including long-term vesting rewards.
* **Platform Credits:** Promo credits for advertising or content boosts.
* **Real-World Items:** Merchandise, event tickets, or hardware.

**Secondary Market:** If you don't wish to wait for a campaign's conclusion, you can sell your Ticket NFT to other users. High-tier tickets (for campaigns with large $MESI pools) often carry significant secondary market value.

## Training Quality Score (TQS)

Your **TQS** is a dynamic reputation metric that determines your eligibility for premium campaigns.

## Compliance & Safeguards

Train2Earn is engineered for global regulatory standards:
* **Privacy First:** The opt-in model is fully compliant with GDPR and PDPA data regulations.
* **Verified Participation:** Mandatory KYC reduces the risk of spam and ensures rewards reach real users.
* **Legal Framework:** Tickets are categorized as NFTs representing proof-of-work, providing a flexible regulatory structure.
