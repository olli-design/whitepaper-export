**Train2Earn** is Mesi’s opt-in program that lets users (creators and fans) contribute to training the platform’s AI systems. In return, participants earn rewards such as $MESI tokens and exclusive access to rewards and perks.

The system is built around **consent**, **transparency,** **quality control**, **and fairness** - ensuring that both data contribution and reward distribution happen in a secure and gamified way.

## Key Principles

| Principle              | Implementation                                                                    | Outcome                                          |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Informed Consent**   | Users choose whether to join via in-app prompt; all scopes are clearly described. | User trust & legal compliance.                   |
| **Reward Incentives**  | Earn $MESI and perks tied to contribution quality.                                | Higher-quality data, more engagement.            |
| **Anti-Abuse Filters** | KYC, anomaly filters, human audits.                                               | Protection from spam, Sybil, or poisoned inputs. |
| **Transparency**       | Training stats, public audits, flagged behavior logic.                            | Platform accountability.                         |

## How It Works

Once users opt in, the app may ask for their help in several ways:

* Answering questions from the AI (via message-style prompts).
* Rating pictures or their current mood.
* Completing short questionnaires or polls.

Each time there’s a new Train2Earn campaign, a limited group of users is selected. Everyone who completes their tasks properly receives a “**Ticket**”, which acts as proof of participation and gateway to the next phase: rewards.

## Earning Tickets & Rewards

Ticket is first issued as a placeholder. Once a user's input passes quality checks, it becomes a **tradeable NFT ticket**.

* These NFT tickets allow users to **join exclusive rewards**.
* Prices vary per campaign: $MESI token packs (including long-term vesting prizes), promo credits, real-world items, and more.
* The better users’ **Training Quality Score**, the more campaigns they can enter and the better their chances of winning.

If preferred, they can **sell or trade their Ticket NFT** to other users on the Mesi marketplace -  especially if the campaign offers high-tier rewards like 100k $MESI, merchandise, or even rare promotional slots.

## Training Quality Score (TQS)

Consistent, high-quality contributions increase your score. A higher TQS gives you access to more campaigns and better rewards., this is ensured by:

* **Automatic Filters** - These detect suspicious behavior (e.g., copy-paste patterns, bot-like timing, mass uploads).
* **Manual Reviews** (HITL) - Human staff periodically review samples, flag edge cases, and remove harmful or misleading entries.
* **Trust Score Decay** - If their account triggers too many flags or breaks the rules, their score drops and they may be excluded from future campaigns or lose reward eligibility.

## Compliance Safeguards

Train2Earn was designed with privacy and legal safety in mind:

* **Opt-in model** meets global data regulations (e.g. GDPR, PDPA).
* **Rewards are merit-based**, not purely chance-based.
* **All participants complete KYC**, reducing risk of Sybil and spam.
* **Tickets are NFTs**, not lottery entries, for regulatory flexibility.<br>
