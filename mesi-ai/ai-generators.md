## Image Creator

Generate high-fidelity visuals using voice, text, or reference images from your gallery.

### Key Capabilities
* **Prompt-to-Image:** Create visuals from descriptive voice or text prompts.
* **Image-to-Image:** Use existing photos to influence the pose, style, or composition of a new generation.
* **Advanced Editing:** Swap backgrounds, refine facial features, modify outfits, or apply complex artistic filters (e.g., "Game of Thrones style").

<Warning>
  **Identity & Compliance:** If you generate images of yourself or any human face, you **must** label your account as an **AI Account**. Failure to do so may result in rejected prompts or account sanctions for misleading users. [Learn more about Account Types](/path-to-real-vs-ai).
</Warning>
