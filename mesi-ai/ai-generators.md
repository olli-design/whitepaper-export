## Image creator

You can use AI to create images from:

* your voice or text prompts
* other images saved in your gallery

For example, you might say:

_“Make a selfie using the pose and expression from these photos in my phone gallery. I want to wear winter clothes, with a mountain background (I’m uploading the exact image for it). Then, make it look like a Game of Thrones poster and add the text ‘Winter is Coming.’”_

In addition to generating new images, the AI **can** **enhance or edit existing photos**. It can:

* Adjust the background
* Refine selfies
* Modify outfit details
* Apply stylish visual effects
* And more

Please note that if you generate photos of yourself (or basically any human/face) using images creator, you need to label your account as an AI account first, otherwise, your generation prompt will be rejected or you might be exposed to sanctions for misleading your user. Please refer to [Real vs AI accounts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j_1_GBLX02jDs8hRfUU0CSNB2oRfbSaex3oWP9c5-O0/edit?tab=t.stlbl8knsfb4) for more details.

Similarly to the Image Creator, this feature allows you to use AI to create custom memes and emojis. You can generate content from:

* Saying or typing what you want.
* Using pictures from your phone.
* Starting with existing memes and emojis.

## Music Creator

#### Example use case

_Susan sees a peaceful mountain view and wants to create music that feels like that moment. She uploads a picture of the mountains, writes that it’s "calm and peaceful with soft winds," and picks the "serene" mood. The tool makes a track with soft sounds and gentle melodies that match her memory. She saves the clip as an MP4 called "Relaxing mountain sound (meditation, study, sleep) - 1h" and uploads it to Mesi as an NFT._

## Sound clip creator

Creators can use AI prompts to make simple audio samples, for example:

* the sound of falling rocks, singing birds, wind, car engines, etc.&#x20;
* bass beats, sound waves, specific frequency sounds, etc.&#x20;
* instrument sounds&#x20;
* custom audio effects

Once generated, they can work with Mesi AI or manually to adjust and improve the sounds and use them for their own purpose or upload to Mesi Sound Clips Library linked music creator, and set licensing fees for usage (or make them free).
