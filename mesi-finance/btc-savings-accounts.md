Mesi allows creators to hedge against volatility and build long-term value by bridging native platform earnings with the world's premier digital asset. As detailed in our [Payments & Payouts](/technology-and-backend/payments-and-payouts) section, users can opt-in to a high-security BTC savings framework.

## The Savings Mechanism

The BTC Savings system operates as a secondary layer following your instant **\$MESI** payout. This ensure you have immediate liquidity while still building a "HODL" position.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Allocate Earnings">
    Define a percentage of your **\$MESI** payouts to be automatically converted into Bitcoin.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automated Conversion">
    Mesi executes the trade via integrated institutional exchanges to secure the best market rate at the time of withdrawal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Secure Custody">
    The acquired BTC is moved to a dedicated, off-chain custodial vault managed by Mesi for maximum security.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Conversion & Tier Limits

To ensure sustainable liquidity and fair access, BTC conversions are governed by the following constraints:

| Limit Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Monthly Cap** | Up to **5%** of your previous month's total earnings can be converted. |
| **Tier Maximums** | Your [Account Tier](/gamification/user-tiers-and-creator-limits) determines the total USDC-equivalent value you can hold in the savings pool. |
| **Genesis Rule** | During the first 30 days post-launch, a fixed global conversion limit applies to all users. |

## Unlocking & Liquidity

Bitcoin reserves are subject to a **Gradual Release Schedule** to encourage long-term holding and platform stability.



* **Daily Accrual:** Claimable balances increase by **1/60th** every 24 hours.
* **Full Maturity:** Users obtain 100% withdrawal rights to their accumulated BTC after **60 days** of continuous holding.

## Yield Generation (mBTC)

While your Bitcoin is held within the Mesi vault, it isn't sitting idle. Mesi employs institutional-grade DeFi strategies to generate additional yield on the total pool.

* **DeFi Strategies:** Yield is generated through staking, lending, and liquidity provisioning.
* **Balance Growth:** A portion of these earnings is redistributed back to users, effectively increasing your BTC balance over time.
* **mBTC Utility:** You can spend your **unlocked** BTC portions instantly within the Mesi app using **mBTC** (Mesi’s off-chain BTC equivalent).

<Warning>
  **Market Risk:** Mesi does not guarantee fixed interest rates. Yield returns vary based on DeFi market conditions and network opportunities.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  **Pro-Tip:** Enabling BTC savings is a "set-and-forget" strategy. By allocating just 5% of your **\$MESI** payouts monthly, you can build a significant Bitcoin reserve without ever needing to use an external exchange.
