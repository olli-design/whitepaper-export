# BTC Savings Accounts

As mentioned in [Payment and Processing](../technology-and-backend/payments-and-payouts.md), users can convert a portion of their $MESI profits instead of instant payouts into **BTC**, which is then deposited into a dedicated savings account.

## How BTC Savings Work

Users can allocate a portion of their $MESI token payouts to a BTC savings account.

* After an instant payout in $MESI tokens, users can choose to convert a portion into BTC.
* BTC is purchased automatically via an external exchange.
* Acquired BTC is held securely in off-chain savings accounts managed by Mesi.

Users then gradually unlock their Bitcoin holdings over time.

## Conversion Limits

BTC conversions are subject to two important limits:

* **Monthly Limit:** Up to 5% of last month's earnings can be converted into BTC. (A fixed conversion limit applies to all users during the first month after launch.)
* **Tier-Based Maximums:** Higher user tiers allow for larger BTC savings allocations, based on USDC-equivalent values.

## Unlocking BTC Balances

BTC saved in the Mesi savings system is **unlocked gradually**. Claimable balances increase by 1/60 each day. Full BTC withdrawal rights are obtained after 60 days of accumulation.

## Yield Generation and Additional Profits

While held by Mesi, the BTC savings pool is actively managed to generate yield through:

* Staking,
* Lending,
* Web3 liquidity provisioning and other decentralized finance (DeFi) opportunities.

A portion of this yield is returned to users by increasing their BTC savings balances over time.

**Note:** Mesi does not guarantee fixed interest rates. Returns vary based on market conditions and available Web3 opportunities.

## Spending with Off-Chain BTC (mBTC)

Users can also spend unlocked portions of their BTC within the Mesi app:

* Payments made with mBTC (off-chain Bitcoin equivalent) are based on the proportion of unlocked balance.
* This enables flexible in-app spending while savings continue to grow.
