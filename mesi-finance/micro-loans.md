Mesi offers a simple loan program to help creators get money for their projects.

## How to Apply

* Creators need to fill out a loan application form.
* Each month, Mesi sets a budget that the platform can spend on the loans.&#x20;
* The amount creators can borrow depends on their [account tier.](../gamification/user-tiers-and-creator-limits.md)
* Applications are reviewed in the order they are submitted. If the budget runs out before your application is reviewed, it will be rejected. The process operates on a first-come, first-served basis.
* To apply, creators must offer collateral in $MESI tokens, worth at least three times (300%) the loan amount.

## Application review process

* Creators choose how much they want to borrow and how long they need to pay it back (between 2 and 12 months). Longer payback times mean higher interest rates.
* Offering more collateral than required can increase the chances of approval.

#### What Mesi Looks At

Mesi checks these things when reviewing applications:

* How trustworthy the creator is.
* How active their gallery is on Mesi?
* Their past earnings.
* Their plan is to pay back the loan.
* How much collateral they are offering?
* Why they need the loan and how they plan to use it.

## What Could Happen

* **Rejection**
* **Conditional Approval**: The loan application is pre-approved, but the creator must increase the collateral to the amount specified by Mesi, or shorten the payback period. Otherwise, the application is rejected.&#x20;
* **Approval**: The loan application is accepted as is.

## Paying Back the Loan

Creators can pay back the loan manually using a repayment tool on the platform, or they can allocate a portion of their profits and rewards for automatic loan repayment in their profile settings.&#x20;

## What Happens if You Don’t Pay

If the loan isn’t paid back on time, Mesi can liquidate the provided collateral fully or partially. This can also happen if:

* The collateral value drops below 200% of the loan amount.
* The creator loses the account tier that has been needed for the loan.
* The creator breaks rules, like:
* Uploading copyrighted content without permission.
  * Not using the platform for a long time.
  * Getting their account suspended.

Mesi has full discretion in deciding the portion of collateral required to be liquidated and the process of liquidation in cases where rules are broken.
