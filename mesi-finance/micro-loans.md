Mesi provides a simplified lending framework designed specifically for creators. This program allows you to unlock liquidity for production costs, equipment, or marketing without selling your underlying **\$MESI** holdings.



## Application Requirements

To maintain a sustainable lending pool, Mesi operates on a monthly budget cycle. Once the monthly allocation is exhausted, further applications are closed until the following month.

* **Priority:** Applications are processed on a **first-come, first-served** basis.
* **Tier Constraints:** Your maximum borrowing limit is tied directly to your [Account Tier](/gamification/user-tiers-and-creator-limits).
* **Collateral (LTV):** You must provide a minimum of **300% collateral** in **\$MESI** tokens relative to the loan value.

---

## The Review Process

When you submit a request, Mesi's risk engine evaluates several factors beyond just collateral to ensure ecosystem stability.

### Loan Terms
Creators can customize their terms within the following ranges:
* **Duration:** 2 to 12 months.
* **Interest:** Rates scale based on the duration (longer terms = higher interest).
* **Approval Boost:** Providing collateral above the 300% minimum significantly increases the probability of instant approval.

## Application Outcomes

After review, your application will receive one of three statuses:

1.  **Approval:** The loan is issued immediately to your wallet.
2.  **Conditional Approval:** Pre-approved, provided you increase collateral or shorten the repayment period.
3.  **Rejection:** The application is denied due to budget exhaustion or risk factors.

## Repayment & Liquidation

Mesi offers flexible repayment tools to help creators maintain their standing and protect their collateral.

### Repayment Methods
* **Manual Repayment:** Use the platform's debt management tool to pay in installments.
* **Auto-Pay:** Redirect a fixed percentage of your daily earnings and rewards directly toward the loan balance.

### Liquidation Risks


To protect the lending pool, **\$MESI** collateral may be partially or fully liquidated if:
* **Health Factor:** The collateral value drops below **200%** of the loan amount.
* **Delinquency:** The loan is not paid back within the agreed timeframe.
* **Tier Loss:** You lose the required [Account Tier](/gamification/user-tiers-and-creator-limits) during the loan term.
* **Compliance Violation:** Account suspension, copyright infringement, or prolonged inactivity.

<Warning>
  **Note on Volatility:** Because **\$MESI** is a market-traded asset, its value can fluctuate. Always monitor your collateral ratio to avoid automatic liquidation during market downturns.

<Tip>
  **Borrowing Strategy:** Start with a small loan and a high collateral ratio (400%+) to build your "Trust Score." This will make future, larger loan approvals significantly faster.
