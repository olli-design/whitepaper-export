# Fan Funding

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Fan funding.png" alt="" width="197"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Mesi offers creators a way to fund their projects by engaging their fan communities directly—without giving up ownership or dealing with complex financial instruments.

Through Mesi’s Fan-Funded Perk Model, creators can launch funding campaigns for upcoming projects (such as albums, podcasts, or videos) and offer exclusive perks to supporters in return. These perks relate to platform discounts, user tiers, engagement score, VIP access and merchandise.  &#x20;

No upfront payment is required from creators. The creator chooses a perk package from Mesi and sets the funding goal.&#x20;

Fans contribute by purchasing NFTs tied to the selected perks. Funds are held in a smart contract until the goal is reached. If successful, Mesi automatically deducts the cost of the perk package from the raised amount, delivers the perks to fans, and transfers the remaining balance to the creator. If the goal isn’t met, the campaign is canceled and contributions are refunded where applicable.

Fans receive the perks and access—not ownership (no revenue share, no rights transfer)

Creators keep full control over their content and IP while being able to fund their projects with the support of their fans.&#x20;

### How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1\. Creator selects a perk package from the platform (e.g., "Golden Honey Album Package" worth 1,000 USDC).

2\. They launch a fan funding campaign:&#x20;

* “Help me raise 10,000 USDC to produce my new album.”
* Fans buy limited-edition NFTs that grant perks from the selected package.

3\. If the campaign hits the target:

The platform automatically deducts 1,000 USDC from the raised funds for the perk package

* Creator receives 9,000 USDC
* Perks are distributed to fans

4\. If the campaign fails:

* No funds are collected
* No payment due to the platform
* No perks are distributed
