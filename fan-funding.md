Mesi’s **Fan-Funded Perk Model** allows creators to finance upcoming projects—like albums, podcasts, or films—by engaging their community directly. Unlike traditional crowdfunding, this model removes the creator's upfront financial risk and the fan's legal complexity.

## The Perk-Based Model

Creators fund their work by offering exclusive platform benefits rather than equity. These perks are bundled into packages and delivered via NFTs. 

### Available Perk Categories
* **Platform Discounts:** Reduced fees for subscriptions or PPV content.
* **Tier Boosts:** Temporary or permanent upgrades to a fan's [User Tier](/gamification/user-tiers-and-creator-limits).
* **Engagement Multipliers:** Bonuses to a fan’s [Engagement Score](/path-to-engagement).
* **VIP Access:** Early entry to live streams or "Bid-to-Meet" priority.
* **Physical Goods:** Integration with creator merchandise.

## How It Works

Mesi handles the escrow, perk fulfillment, and refunds automatically via smart contracts.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a Perk Package">
    The creator chooses a pre-configured perk bundle from Mesi (e.g., a "Gold Package" worth 1,000 USDC). **No upfront payment is required.**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch the Campaign">
    The creator sets a funding goal (e.g., 10,000 USDC). Fans support the project by purchasing limited-edition "Perk NFTs."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Smart Contract Escrow">
    All contributions are held securely in a smart contract. If the goal is reached, the platform automatically deducts the cost of the perks (1,000 USDC) and releases the remainder (9,000 USDC) to the creator.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automated Delivery">
    Upon success, the platform instantly distributes the digital perks to the NFT holders. If the campaign fails, the smart contract automatically refunds all fans.
  </Step>
</Steps>
