# Banking Service Layer

Mesi integrates 'Banking as a Service' (BAAS) into its platform, creating a seamless transaction experience for users transferring funds into and from the app.

## On-Ramp Gateway

Users can purchase $MESI tokens using payment cards or bank transfers.

## Payment Card

The Mesi payment card is linked directly to users' Mesi wallets. It facilitates both online and in-store transactions using $MESI tokens. It offers **cashback** bonuses and **ATM withdrawals** with size and limits proportional to user account tier level.

## Off-Ramp Gateway

Users can convert $MESI tokens into fiat or stablecoins through the Mesi Payment Card. This feature is only available to KYC-verified creators.&#x20;

Direct conversions of $MESI tokens to users' bank accounts are currently not available.&#x20;

## Direct conversion to BTC and BTC savings&#x20;

Mesi offers a direct payout conversion service where users can opt to receive their instantly withdrawn $MESI earnings as BTC for a small conversion fee. BTC is then held on a dedicated saving account (Mesi custody vault, not user wallet) which allows users to accrue additional BTC savings, accumulated with the amount they already have.&#x20;
