Mesi utilizes a robust **Banking as a Service (BaaS)** layer to bridge the gap between digital assets and traditional financial systems. This infrastructure allows users to move value in and out of the ecosystem with the same ease as a traditional banking app.

## On-Ramp: Funding Your Journey
The On-Ramp gateway is designed for friction-free onboarding. Users can acquire **\$MESI** tokens directly using familiar payment methods:

* **Payment Cards:** Instant purchases via Credit or Debit cards.
* **Bank Transfers:** Secure SEPA/Wire transfers for larger allocations.
* **In-App Purchases (IAP):** Direct native billing through Apple and Google mobile stores.

## The Mesi Payment Card
The Mesi Payment Card is a physical and virtual debit card linked directly to your platform wallet, turning your **\$MESI** balance into real-world purchasing power.



### Card Features & Tiered Benefits
Your card’s performance scales with your [Account Tier](/gamification/user-tiers-and-creator-limits). Higher tiers unlock superior financial terms:

| Benefit | Tier 1 (Base) | Tier 5 (Elite) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cashback Rewards** | 0.1% in **\$MESI** | **Up to 5%** in **\$MESI** |
| **ATM Withdrawals** | Standard Limits | **Premium Limits** |
| **Foreign Exchange** | Standard Fees | **Zero FX Fees** |

## Off-Ramp: Liquidity & Exits
Mesi provides a secure exit strategy for creators and users to realize their earnings in the physical economy.

* **Card Off-Ramp:** Instantly convert **\$MESI** into fiat or stablecoins at the point of sale using the Mesi Payment Card.
* **KYC Requirement:** To comply with global financial regulations, off-ramp features are exclusively available to **KYC-verified creators**.
* **Settlement Note:** Direct "Token-to-Bank" transfers are not currently supported; the Mesi Card remains the primary vehicle for fiat liquidity.

## Automated BTC Savings & Vault
For users focused on long-term wealth preservation, Mesi offers an automated "HODL" bridge.



### The Mesi Custody Vault
Instead of manual trading, users can opt into the **BTC Savings Program**:
1.  **Direct Conversion:** Instantly convert a portion of your withdrawn **\$MESI** earnings into Bitcoin (BTC).
2.  **Institutional Security:** Converted BTC is moved to the **Mesi Custody Vault**—a dedicated, high-security storage environment (separate from the standard user wallet).
3.  **Compound Growth:** This allows users to accrue a BTC balance over time, benefiting from Bitcoin's long-term market position while earning on Mesi.

<Note>
  **Conversion Fees:** A small transaction fee is applied to BTC conversions to cover network costs and liquidity provision.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **Pro-Tip:** Using the Mesi Card for daily purchases while keeping your main balance in the BTC Vault is the most effective way to balance immediate liquidity with long-term asset growth.
