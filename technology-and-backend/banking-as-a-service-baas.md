## The Mesi Payment Card
The Mesi Payment Card serves as the ultimate utility tool for your earnings, linking your digital wallet directly to global point-of-sale (POS) systems.

* **Everyday Spending:** Use your **\$MESI** tokens for online shopping and in-store transactions anywhere major cards are accepted.
* **Tiered Cashback:** Earn rewards on every purchase. Your cashback percentage scales with your [Account Tier](/gamification/user-tiers-and-creator-limits).
* **ATM Access:** Withdraw physical cash from ATMs globally. Daily and monthly limits are determined by your current tier.

## Off-Ramp: Liquidity and Conversion
Mesi offers a streamlined exit strategy for creators to convert their digital success into spendable fiat.

### Instant Conversion
Currently, the primary off-ramp is the **Mesi Payment Card**. This allows for the instant conversion of **\$MESI** tokens into fiat or stablecoins during the transaction process.

<Warning>
  **KYC Requirement:** Direct off-ramp and card features are exclusively available to **KYC-verified creators**.
</Warning>

### Market Integrity
To protect the token economy, direct conversions are executed based on real-time market value. 
* **Slippage Protection:** The conversion logic accounts for the inherent market impact of the transaction, ensuring the liquidity pool remains balanced.
* **Current Support:** Direct bank transfers are not supported at this time; the Mesi Payment Card remains the primary vehicle for fiat liquidity.
