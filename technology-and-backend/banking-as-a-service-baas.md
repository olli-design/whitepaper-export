# Banking as a Service (BaaS)

Mesi integrates a full **Banking as a Service (BaaS)** solution to create a seamless bridge between the Web3 ecosystem and traditional financial systems.

Thanks to the BaaS service,  users can easily transfer funds into and out of the Mesi platform, use $MESI tokens for everyday payments, and access a variety of value-added financial features.

## On-Ramp Gateway

Users can fund their Mesi wallets by purchasing $MESI tokens using a **payment card**, **in-app purchases (IAP)**, or **bank transfers via a third-party app**.

## Mesi Payment Card

The Mesi Payment Card is directly linked to users' Mesi wallets. It enables:

* **Online and in-store transactions** using $MESI tokens.
* **Cashback rewards** are based on account tier (higher tiers = higher cashback).
* **ATM withdrawals** with withdrawal limited and determined by the user tier.

## Off-Ramp Gateway

Currently, users can perform direct conversion of $MESI tokens into fiat or stablecoins only through the Mesi Payment Card. This option is only available to KYC-verified creators.  Such direct conversion is instant and based on the current token value (the inherent value impact that such a sell transaction would cause is also taken into account).&#x20;

Direct bank transfers are not currently supported.<br>
