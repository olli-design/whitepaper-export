Mesi bridges the gap between traditional payment rails and blockchain efficiency. By utilizing a sophisticated treasury model, the platform ensures that creators are paid instantly while maintaining the economic integrity of the **\$MESI** token.



## Payment Processing

Mesi facilitates transactions through two primary channels to ensure global accessibility:

* **Mesi Native Infrastructure:** Powers the Web App, handling direct blockchain transactions, smart contract interactions, and **\$MESI** native payments.
* **Google/Apple Pay:** Integrated into the mobile ecosystem to provide a seamless fiat experience for non-crypto users.

## Transactional Deductions

To maintain the ecosystem, all payments and listed base prices are subject to transparent deductions at the transaction layer:

| Fee Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Mesi Commission** | Platform service fee used for maintenance, R&D, and ecosystem growth. |
| **Licensing Rights** | Automated distribution to original IP holders for content usage. |
| **Network Fees** | Standard gas fees required to record the transaction on the Creator Chain. |

## Creator Payouts & Treasury Logic

Mesi is the only platform that offers **Instant Payouts** through a dynamic treasury and mint-and-burn mechanism.



### The Instant Payout Guarantee
When a creator claims their earnings, they are instantly converted into **\$MESI** tokens at the current market price.

1.  **Liquidity Pool:** The Mesi Treasury fulfills payouts directly from its active liquidity reserves.
2.  **Emergency Minting:** If withdrawal demand temporarily exceeds the treasury's liquid capacity, the protocol mints additional tokens to ensure creators are never delayed.
3.  **Supply Neutralization:** To prevent inflation, any surplus created by minting is neutralized. Mesi either **burns tokens** from cold reserves or executes **strategic buybacks** to return the total supply to its intended equilibrium.

### Bitcoin Savings Integration
Creators looking for long-term wealth accumulation can opt to convert their instant **\$MESI** payouts into Bitcoin (BTC).
* The conversion occurs immediately after the withdrawal.
* The acquired BTC is deposited into a secure, dedicated savings account.
* A small processing fee applies to the conversion to cover network and exchange costs.

<Tip>
  **Pro-Tip:** Managing your assets within the Mesi ecosystem (such as keeping tokens locked) often provides higher [Engagement Ratings](/path-to-engagement) than moving them to external wallets immediately.
