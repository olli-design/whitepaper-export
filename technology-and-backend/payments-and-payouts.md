All payments within Mesi app are managed via:

* **Mesi Platform Native Infrastructure**: For web-app transactions.
* **Google/Apple Pay**: For mobile-app transactions.

## Deductions

Payments and base prices may include the following deductions:

* **Mesi Commission Fees**
* **Licensing Rights Fees**
* **Blockchain Transaction Fees**

## Creator Payouts in MESI Tokens

Payments to creators are converted into $MESI tokens at the current market price. Creators can claim their earnings directly through their user profile.

## Instant Payouts & conversion to BTC

* The Mesi treasury ensures immediate payouts in $MESI tokens.
* If claims exceed the treasury's immediate payout capacity, additional tokens are minted to meet the demand. To offset the surplus created by minting, $MESI tokens are withdrawn from cold reserves and burned. Alternatively, strategic buybacks and token burns are implemented to restore balance and return the token supply to its original level.  Withdrawn $MESI tokens are transferred to the user's Mesi wallet.
* Users can choose to convert their instant $MESI payouts to BTC for an additional fee. The conversion takes place after the initial, instant withdrawal of $MESI. The acquired BTC is then deposited into a dedicated savings account allowing users to accumulate their Bitcoin balance over time.

## Further Use of $MESI Tokens

Creators have full control over their withdrawn tokens and can:

* Trade them.
* Add them to liquidity pools.
* Transfer them to other blockchain wallets.
