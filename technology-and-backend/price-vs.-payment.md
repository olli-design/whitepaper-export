# Price vs. Payment

On the Mesi App, you can pay for things in two main methods:

## Same Format Payments

This means the price and payment match. For example:

* **Fiat money** (like dollars) = Paid with fiat money
* **Stablecoins** = Paid with stablecoins

**MESI tokens** = Paid with MESI tokens

## Mixed Format Payments

This means the price and payment are in different currencies. For example:

* Fiat money → Stablecoins
* Fiat money → MESI tokens
* Stablecoins → MESI tokens
* MESI tokens → Fiat money
* MESI tokens → Stablecoins
* Stablecoins → Fiat money
