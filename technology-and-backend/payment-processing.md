# Payment Processing

## How Payments Are Managed

Payments within the Mesi platform are processed through two primary systems:

* **Native Infrastructure:** Used for all web-app transactions, and dedicated to supporting $MESI transactions and blockchain-based activities.
* **Google/ Apple in-app payments (IAP)**: Used for all mobile app transactions, where payments are processed only in fiat.&#x20;

Regardless of payment method, all withdrawals from the platform are completed either in USDC or $MESI tokens.  Artists who choose $MESI receive a 10% bonus on their earnings, adding extra value for those invested in the platform.

## Payment Deductions

Payments and listed base prices may include the following automatic deductions:

* **Mesi Commission Fees**&#x20;
* **Licensing Rights Fees**&#x20;
* **Blockchain Transaction Fees**&#x20;

These fees are transparently applied at the transaction layer.

## Instant Settlements for Creators

Creators benefit from instant payouts for any withdrawal (except from music creators, who receive their payments monthly)&#x20;

It means that unlike on other similar portals with long withdrawal processing times and delays, on Mesi, all earnings are converted to $MESI / USDC tokens and credited to the creator’s wallet immediately.&#x20;

If reserves for making such a payout are insufficient, additional $MESI tokens are minted temporarily. Any token supply surplus (temporary inflation) is neutralized by burning reserves or executing token buybacks to protect the ecosystem economy.\
\
Once withdrawn, creators can use the tokens for whatever purpose they want, e.g., trade them, add them to liquidity pools, or transfer them to other blockchain wallets.

Creators can also connect their bank account to Mesi as well, and receive payouts in FIAT currency, or use funds instantly via the Mesi debit card - which gives creators fast and direct access to their assets.

## Bitcoin savings accounts&#x20;

Creators can open free Bitcoin savings accounts; if they do, a portion of their earned tokens will be converted to BTC tokens upon withdrawal and moved to a dedicated, secure custodial account hosted by Mesi.&#x20;

Thanks to that approach, users can keep accumulating BTC reserves over time, and additionally benefit from their potential long-term growth in the future.&#x20;

Creators also have the option to convert a portion of their $MESI withdrawals into Bitcoin (BTC).&#x20;
