Mesi utilizes a high-speed financial engine that bridges legacy mobile payment systems with the native Creator Chain. This ensures that while fans enjoy a familiar checkout experience, creators benefit from the speed and utility of blockchain-based settlements.



## Core Infrastructure

Payments are managed through two distinct pipelines depending on the user environment:

* **Native Infrastructure:** Powers the Web App and all blockchain-based activities. It handles **\$MESI** tokens, stablecoins, and direct smart contract interactions.
* **Mobile In-App Payments (IAP):** Integrated with the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. These handle fiat transactions exclusively to comply with mobile ecosystem regulations.

## Creator Settlements

Regardless of how a fan pays, Mesi provides a unified and incentivized settlement process for creators.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Instant Payouts" icon="bolt">
    Earnings are converted and credited to your wallet immediately upon transaction. *Note: Music creators receive monthly settlements.*
  </Card>
  <Card title="The \$MESI Bonus" icon="percentage">
    Choose to receive your earnings in **\$MESI** tokens to receive an automatic **10% bonus** on your total payout.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Settlement Logistics
If platform reserves are temporarily insufficient for an instant payout, the system mints temporary **\$MESI** tokens to ensure liquidity. To protect the economy, any resulting inflation is neutralized through:
1.  **Reserve Burns:** Removing tokens from the internal treasury.
2.  **Buybacks:** Purchasing tokens from the open market to restore equilibrium.

## Payment Deductions

To maintain a transparent ecosystem, all fees are applied and visible at the transaction layer:

| Fee Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Mesi Commission** | Standard platform fee for infrastructure and maintenance. |
| **Licensing Fees** | Distributed to IP holders for content used in the transaction. |
| **Network Fees** | Gas fees required to process the transaction on the Creator Chain. |

## Asset Flexibility & Banking

Once funds are in your wallet, you have full control over your assets.

* **Blockchain Mobility:** Transfer tokens to external wallets or add them to Liquidity Pools.
* **Fiat Off-Ramp:** Connect your bank account to receive traditional currency payouts.
* **Mesi Debit Card:** Spend your earnings instantly at any point-of-sale (POS) globally.
