## Content Quality & Compliance
To ensure a high-signal environment, Mesi maintains strict standards.
* **Originality:** Plagiarism or no-value "bot" content is strictly prohibited.
* **Enforcement:** Accounts violating copyright or platform guidelines will be disqualified from rewards and suspended from the migration.

## Migration to Mainnet

The transition from Testnet to Mainnet is designed to be seamless. Compliant accounts will automatically migrate their digital identity to the live environment.

  Upon Mainnet deployment, the **\$MESI** tokens earned via Nectar Points will be distributed. This ensures that the earliest contributors enter the live economy with a liquid stake in the platform's success.

<Tip>
  **Pro-Tip:** Focus on "Bug Reporting" and "Feedback" tasks. High-quality technical feedback often carries higher Nectar Point multipliers than standard social tasks.
