# First on Mesi Incentivized Test App & Migration to Mainnet

Before launching the Mesi Chain mainnet and mobile app, Mesi will roll out (**first on Mesi**) an **incentivized testnet** along with a **test version of the Mesi App**, accessible via web browser. The purpose of the test app is to involve our community early in the platform’s development by encouraging early content creation, rewarding participation, and gathering valuable feedback for the Mesi team.

This test phase invites early adopters to explore the platform, test blockchain functionality, and provide feedback critical to the final release.&#x20;

Participants can create **affiliate,** **fan, and creator accounts**, and engage in real-use activities, including:

* Creating and interacting with content
* Testing NFT creation and trading
* Performing transactions and smart contract interactions
* Holding, staking, and locking $MESI tokens
* Completing social and platform-specific tasks
* Reporting improvement ideas, bugs, or vulnerabilities
* Providing ad traffic and referrals

**To join, users will:**

1. Create a Mesi account on the test app
2. Connect their social media accounts via the test app dashboard
3. Choose a role - affiliate, fan, or creator - which will shape their tasks and rewards

The test app will launch with core features and evolve with time. Throughout the process, users will earn Nectar Points based on engagement, task completion, and content quality. These points will:

* Be converted into $MESI tokens
* Be airdropped to mainnet wallets upon migration
* Represent early participation and contribution to the Mesi ecosystem

## **Content Quality & Compliance**

Creators are expected to publish meaningful, original content. Accounts that post spam, plagiarized, or no-value material, or that violate copyright or platform guidelines, will be **disqualified from rewards** and **subject to suspension**.

**Migration to Mainnet & Rewards Distribution**

At the end of the testnet phase, compliant accounts will **migrate to the Mesi mainnet**, preserving:

* Profiles and roles
* Galleries and content\
  Activity history and reputation

All eligible users will receive their **converted $MESI rewards via airdrop** directly to their mainnet wallets, enabling a seamless transition to the full platform with recognition of their early involvement.
