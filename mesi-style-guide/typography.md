## Best Practices

* **Legibility:** Maintain a minimum line height of **1.5** for body text to ensure high readability for long-form content.
* **Contrast:** Ensure all text meets **WCAG 2.1** contrast standards against background colors. 
* **Hierarchy:** Do not skip heading levels (e.g., jumping from H1 to H3) to maintain a logical structure for screen readers.

<Tip>
  **Pro-Tip:** For mobile development, utilize the **12px Medium** body weight for data-heavy screens to maximize screen real estate while maintaining clarity.
