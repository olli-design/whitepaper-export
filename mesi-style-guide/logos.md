# Logos

## Main logo variants

Mesi's main logo consists of a rounded rectangle and a liquid drop cut-out, an icon that's also used across the Mesi app to denote pieces of content. There are two basic versions of the main logo, that can be used where appropriate.&#x20;

New variants can be generated as needed, as long as they only use a single solid color, and the contrast ratio of 3:1 is maintained at all times.
