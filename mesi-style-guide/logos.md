## The Mesi Icon
The core of our visual identity is a rounded rectangle featuring a liquid drop cut-out. This icon is used consistently across the platform to denote individual pieces of content and represents the fluid nature of the Creator Chain.

### Main Logo Variants
Mesi utilizes two primary versions of the logo depending on the background and layout requirements.

**Usage Rules:**
* **Color:** New variants must always utilize a single, solid color.
* **Contrast:** A minimum contrast ratio of **3:1** must be maintained between the logo and its background at all times.
* **Spacing:** Ensure adequate clear space around the logo to maintain visual integrity.
