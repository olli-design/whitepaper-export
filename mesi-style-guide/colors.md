## Accessibility & Contrast

To maintain a professional and readable interface, we adhere to the following guidelines:

* **Contrast Ratios:** Maintain at least a **3:1** ratio for graphic elements and **4.5:1** for body text against backgrounds.
* **Hierarchy:** Use **Mesi Blue** exclusively for primary actions. Use **Deep Space** for all high-value interface foundations.
* **States:** Use **Critical Red** and **Accent Gold** only for their designated system feedback roles (Warnings and Rewards).

<Tip>
  **Pro-Tip:** If you are building a third-party dashboard for Mesi analytics, using the **Deep Space** background with **Mesi Liquid** text provides the best readability for long-form data.
