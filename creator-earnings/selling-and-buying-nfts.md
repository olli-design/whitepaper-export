# Selling & buying NFT's

## Ways to Sell

On the Mesi platform, you can sell your NFTs in **3 ways**:

#### 1. Buy-Now

* You set a price for your NFT, and buyers can purchase it instantly.
* There’s no need for bidding or negotiating.

#### 2. Auction

* You start a bidding process where people compete to buy your NFT.
* The auction lasts between **7 and 35 days** (longer times are available if you have a higher [account tier](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j_1_GBLX02jDs8hRfUU0CSNB2oRfbSaex3oWP9c5-O0/edit?tab=t.odm0afullf6a)).
* The person with the highest bid at the end wins.
* If the last bid was made in the **previous 5 minutes**, the auction is extended by another 15 minutes
* Mesi uses an **escrow system** to make sure the transaction is settled safely. Funds are held in custody and released only until the NFT is successfully transferred to the buyer (please also see the [Post-sale cooldown period](selling-and-buying-nfts.md#post-sale-cooldown-period) for additional escrow release rules)&#x20;

#### 3. Private Bidding

* Buyers can send private offers for NFTs that have been labeled by the owner as **'opened for bidding'**
* As the owner, you can **accept, reject**, or make a **counteroffer**.

## Sales thresholds

There are 3 thresholds related to NFT sales, which change proportionally to your account tier. &#x20;

#### Monthly turnover threshold

Applies to the effective sales volumes during a given month. If you go over that threshold, the extra revenue is put into an escrow vault and is gradually released back to you at a rate of **1/30 per day.** Money from subscriptions isn’t part of this limit.

#### Maximum Number of NFTs You Can Offer for Sale at Once

This applies to all the ways to sell NFTs, like Buy-Now, Auction, or Private Bid. In the case of the latter, it applies to all NFTs that are marked as "For Sale" by the owner.

#### Total Value of NFTs You Can Offer for Sale at Once

This limit is about the total value of all the NFTs you’re offering for sale at the same time, no matter how many you list.

## Max sell price implications&#x20;

The maximum selling price is the highest amount you can sell an NFT for. This price is based on a multiplier of the NFT's value, e.g., 0.75x or 2x the value. For more details, check out the "NFT Value & Price" section.

In the case of Private Bids and Auctions, if you sell an NFT for more than the maximum selling price, the surplus will be put in a Mesi escrow vault.

You can get the surplus back when your account tier reaches the level that would have been required not to generate that surplus in the first place.

## Post-sale Cooldown Period

When an NFT is sold, ownership is transferred to the buyer immediately. However, the purchase amount is held in a temporary vault for 48 hours.

During this time, the platform verifies compliance with the content policy, including checks for copyright infringement, identity theft, or inappropriate content.

* **If no issues are detected within 48 hours**, the funds are released to the seller.
* **If violations are confirmed**, the transaction is canceled, and the funds are returned to the buyer.

## Post-sale Violations

If violations related to the sold NFT are found after the post-sale cooldown period, the refund might no longer be possible.&#x20;

Mesi will attempt to freeze the amount needed for a refund in the violator's Mesi app account and associated Mesi wallets. However, their balances might not be enough to cover the loss.&#x20;

If this is the case, a 'debt' will be assigned to the account, and if any revenue is being generated from this account in the future, it will be automatically redirected to the Mesi treasury, from which all aggrieved parties will be compensated (using FIFO order of debts registration). &#x20;

## Violating NFT

Depending on the situation and the nature of the violation, the violating NFT can either be destroyed or transferred to the rightful owner who has a Mesi App account. The choice is made by the aggrieved rightful owner.

Regardless of the NFT's final destination, the rightful owner is entitled to receive all revenues generated by the violating NFT (if recoverable). This amount is added as a debt to the violator's account.

## Account Suspension Policy

The violator's account may be suspended during the investigation and reimbursement process, depending on the severity of the violation. However, suspensions must be handled carefully to avoid further unintentional harm to the affected parties.

For example, suspending an account could stop revenue streams from subscriptions, which might otherwise be used to compensate affected parties. Hence, the Mesi team decides on suspensions on a case-by-case basis.

## Upcoming Selling Methods&#x20;

The following selling methods are also considered potential extensions of NFT sales models.

| Blind Auction | The seller sets a hidden price. Buyers submit bids without seeing others’ offers. The highest bid wins when the auction ends. |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dutch Auction | Prices decrease over time until a buyer makes a purchase.                                                                     |
| NFT Swaps     | Allows users to swap NFTs.                                                                                                    |
| Silent Sale   | The seller sets a fixed, hidden price. The first proposal meeting or exceeding this price wins.                               |
