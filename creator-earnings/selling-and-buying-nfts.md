The Mesi marketplace is built on a foundation of safety and stability. By using automated escrow systems and tier-based thresholds, we ensure a fair environment for both creators and collectors.

## Ways to Sell

Creators can choose from three primary transaction models to move their assets.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Buy-Now" icon="bolt">
    Set a fixed price for instant purchase. Best for high-frequency assets and standard content.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Auction" icon="gavel">
    Initiate a competitive bidding process (7–35 days). Includes a **5-minute anti-sniping extension** to ensure fair winning bids.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Private Bidding" icon="handshake">
    Label your NFT as "Open for Bids." Negotiate directly with buyers via acceptance, rejection, or counteroffers.
  </Card>

## Sales Thresholds & Limits

To prevent market manipulation and manage platform liquidity, Mesi applies three thresholds that scale with your [User Tier](/gamification/user-tiers-and-creator-limits).

* **Monthly Turnover:** Total effective sales volume per month. Revenue exceeding this limit is held in an escrow vault and released at a rate of **1/30 per day**.
* **Inventory Cap:** The maximum number of NFTs you can list for sale simultaneously.
* **Listing Value Cap:** The total aggregate value of all active listings allowed at once.

## The Post-Sale Lifecycle

Mesi uses a mandatory "Cooling-Off" period to protect buyers from fraudulent or infringing content.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Immediate Transfer">
    Upon purchase, the NFT ownership is transferred to the buyer's gallery immediately.
  </Step>
  <Step title="48-Hour Vault">
    The purchase funds are held in a temporary vault while the platform audits the content for copyright or policy violations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verification & Release">
    If no issues are detected, funds are released to the seller. If a violation is found, the transaction is reversed and the buyer is refunded.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Policy Violations & Debt System

If a violation is discovered *after* the 48-hour cooldown, Mesi enforces a strict "Debt" recovery model to compensate the aggrieved parties.

<Warning>
  **Debt & Payout Redirection:** If your account lacks sufficient funds to cover a post-sale refund, a "Debt" is assigned to your profile. Future revenue from any source (subscriptions, ads, etc.) will be automatically redirected to the Mesi Treasury to repay affected buyers via a FIFO (First-In, First-Out) queue.
</Warning>

### Rights of the Original Owner
If an NFT is found to be a violation of another creator's intellectual property:
1. The rightful owner chooses whether to **destroy** the infringing NFT or **transfer** it to their own gallery.
2. The rightful owner is entitled to **all historical revenue** generated by the violating NFT. This amount is added to the violator's debt.

## Upcoming Transaction Models

We are constantly expanding our marketplace features. The following models are currently in development:

| Method | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Blind Auction** | Highest hidden bid wins at the end of the duration. |
| **Dutch Auction** | Price starts high and decreases until the first buyer accepts. |
| **NFT Swaps** | Direct peer-to-peer asset trading. |
| **Silent Sale** | First bidder to meet or exceed a hidden reserve price wins. |

<Note>
  **Account Suspension:** Mesi handles suspensions on a case-by-case basis. We often keep accounts active even during investigations to ensure subscription revenue continues to flow toward compensating victims.
