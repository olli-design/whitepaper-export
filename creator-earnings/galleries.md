A **Mesi Gallery** is a creator's centralized hub for all digital assets. Unlike traditional social media profiles, Mesi Galleries act as permanent digital portfolios, meticulously organized by media type and ownership history.

## Organized Content Discovery

Every gallery is automatically partitioned into three primary sections to ensure a seamless fan experience:
* **Photo Galleries:** High-fidelity images, digital art, and photography.
* **Video Galleries:** Cinematic content and short-form clips.
* **Audio Galleries:** Music, podcasts, and soundscapes.

### Key Management Features
* **Rights Verification:** Upon upload, creators must confirm their legal rights to the assets.
* **Chronological Display:** Content is displayed in a default chronological timeline of creation.
* **Smart Filtering:** Fans can sort and filter content by media type, year of release, and custom tags.
