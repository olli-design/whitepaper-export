A **Trust Pledge** is a financial commitment (in **Fiat** or **Stablecoins**) that is permanently attached to a specific piece of content by the Creator or the current NFT owner. 

These pledges function as a "Security Deposit" for the blockchain, providing a tangible layer of trust and financial protection for buyers and the platform.

## Core Functions

Trust Pledges serve two primary purposes in the Mesi ecosystem:

### 1. Authenticity Guarantee
The pledge acts as a guarantee of **ownership** and **authenticity**. If the validity of the content is compromised—for example, if it is proven to be stolen, unauthentic, or infringing on intellectual property—the Trust Pledge is liquidated.
* **Compensation:** The funds are used to compensate legal claims or damages caused to the platform or other users.
* **Accountability:** It creates a "skin in the game" model that discourages bad actors from uploading fraudulent content.

### 2. Value Enhancement
Trust Pledges directly **increase the market value of an NFT**. 
* **Asset Backing:** Because the pledge stays attached to the NFT, the asset is now backed by a specific amount of liquid currency.
* **Buyer Confidence:** High-value NFTs with large Trust Pledges are seen as safer investments, as the creator has financially staked their reputation on that content.

## How It Works

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Permanent Attachment" icon="link">
    Once a Trust Pledge is committed, it is locked to that specific NFT. If the NFT is sold, the pledge transfers with it to the new owner.

  <Card title="Dynamic Scaling" icon="chart-line">
    Creators or owners can increase the Trust Pledge at any time to further validate the asset or prepare it for a high-value auction.

<Warning>
  **Dispute Resolution:** In the event of a proven authenticity breach, Mesi's arbitration protocol handles the distribution of the Trust Pledge to the affected parties.
