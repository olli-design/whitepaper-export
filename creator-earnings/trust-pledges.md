# Trust pledges

Trust Pledges are **FIAT** or **stablecoins** commitments **permanently attached** to the content by the Creator or NFT owner.  They serve as a **guarantee** of the content's authenticity and **ownership**.

If the validity of the content is compromised - for example, if it is proven to be unauthentic or not owned by Creators - Trust Pledge is used to compensate any legal claims or damages caused to others.

Trust pledges **increase the NFT value**.&#x20;
