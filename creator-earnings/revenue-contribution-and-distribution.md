# Revenue Contribution and Distribution

## Revenue Contribution

As a creator, you can allocate a percentage of your revenue to your gallery. This contribution means that the designated portion of your revenue will be distributed among all NFTs in your gallery (both owned and previously sold).

You can adjust your revenue contribution at any time. However, the revenue share calculation uses a moving average based on the last 12 months of contributions. The value of your current revenue contribution is publicly visible in your gallery description.

**Example 1**: Adam has been contributing 100% of his revenue to his gallery for the past six months. In the seventh month, he reduced his contribution to 50%. In the twelfth month, he received a private bid of $1,000 for one of his NFTs and accepted it. At the time of this transaction, his revenue contribution was calculated as: (6x100% + 5\*50%)/11 = **77%**. He will receive $330, while the remaining $770 will be allocated to his gallery.&#x20;

## Revenue Distribution to NFTs

Revenue contributed to the gallery is distributed among the NFTs based on their engagement ratings - a measure of their ability to generate desired activity on the Mesi platform. The higher an NFT's engagement rating, the greater its share of the gallery revenue. &#x20;

**Note:** The buyer of an NFT does not receive a share of the amount they paid for that NFT.

The formula for Revenue Share among gallery NFTs is:

**Example 2:** Adam owns 10 NFTs. After selling one NFT and contributing $770 to his gallery, the remaining revenue was distributed among the other nine NFTs. Since Adam still owns all of them, he received the entire gallery contribution.

**Example 3:** Adam consistently contributes 50% of his revenue to his gallery. He sells one NFT for $2,000, allocating $1,000 to the gallery. His gallery contains 10 NFTs, four owned by him and six by others. The $1,000 contribution is distributed as follows:

| NFT   | Owner   | Engagement Rating | Revenue Share |
| ----- | ------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| NFT 1 | Adam    | 40                | $200          |
| NFT 2 | Adam    | 30                | $150          |
| NFT 3 | Adam    | 20                | $100          |
| NFT 4 | Adam    | 10                | $50           |
| NFT 5 | Owner 2 | 50                | $250          |
| NFT 6 | Owner 3 | 20                | $100          |
| NFT 7 | Owner 4 | 15                | $75           |
| NFT 8 | Owner 5 | 10                | $50           |
| NFT 9 | Owner 6 | 5                 | $25           |

## Engagement Rewards Distribution

$MESI token rewards incentivize engagement and usage of the Mesi app. Initially, these rewards are funded by the Mesi treasury. Over time, app fees will sustain the reward pools to ensure the long-term economic attractiveness of these rewards.&#x20;

Separate reward pools exist for the mobile and web apps, with distributions occurring every week.

#### Distribution Process:

1. **Gallery Level**: Rewards are allocated to each gallery based on its share of the combined engagement scores of all galleries in the app.
2. **NFT Level**: Rewards allocated to the gallery are divided among its NFTs according to their individual engagement scores, using the same logic as the revenue split formula.
