# NFT value & price

Mesi NFTs are digital items with **value** and **price** attributes.&#x20;

Normally, all digital goods are shown only with the price their owner wants to sell them for. This price might be fair, but it could also be much higher than what the item is actually worth.

To fix this, Mesi shows both the **real value** **of an NFT** and its **price**. This helps people see what they’re paying for and makes the buying process simpler and more trustworthy.

## NFT Earnings Percentage

This metric shows the percentage of total gallery revenue that can be attributed to a specific NFT.

This value represents the contribution of the NFT to the overall earnings generated by the entire gallery it belongs to.

The percentage is publicly visible alongside the NFT value and is calculated based on:

* **Direct earnings from the NFT itself**
* **Assumed equal participation of NFTs in subscription revenues** (e.g., if there are 50 NFTs in the gallery, each is allocated a 1/50 share of the subscription revenues).

**Example**:  A gallery contains 10 NFTs. One NFT has generated direct revenue of $100 in 2024. The gallery’s yearly subscription earnings amount to $5,000. The revenue percentage attributable to the standout NFT is calculated as: **($500+$100) / $5100 = 11.7%**, All other NFTs in the gallery would receive an equal share of the remaining revenue, resulting in **9.8% per NFT**.

This metric enables users to see how much revenue a specific NFT contributes relative to the entire gallery’s earnings.

### NFT Pricing System

The price of the NFT is related to the following events and interactions occurring within the Mesi ecosystem:&#x20;

1. The owner has listed the item for sale using the ‘buy now’ option with a fixed price.
2. The owner has created an auction for that NFT
3. A buyer sends a private bid for an NFT marked as ‘open for bid.’

#### Maximum Price Formula

The highest price an NFT can be sold for follows this formula:

**Max Price = NFT Value × \[n]**

**\[n]** starts at 0.5 and gets higher as the seller's account tier increases.

**Example:** If \[n] is 0.75 and the NFT Value is $1,000, the seller can set a ‘buy-now’ price for up to $750.

#### Maximum Price Limitations

The maximum price limitation affects the following selling methods:

* **Buy-Now**
  * The maximum price sets how much the NFT can be listed for.
* **Auction**
  * If someone bids more than the maximum price, the seller will only get the maximum allowed price.
  * The extra money is held in the Mesi Escrow until the seller reaches a sufficient account tier.
* **Private Bid**
  * If a private offer is higher than the maximum price and the seller accepts it, the extra money goes into escrow, just like in auctions.
