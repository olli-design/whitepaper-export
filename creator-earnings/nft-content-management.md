# NFT content management

## NFTs

When you upload content to the Mesi platform, it becomes an NFT (non-fungible token) - thanks to this

* Each content piece becomes tradable
* We can track who the current owner is
* We can keep immutable account records of the historical activity related to it

## Unique IDs That Stick

Each piece of content you upload gets a **special ID** that can’t be changed. This ID is stored on the blockchain and keeps a detailed record of every action related to your NFT, such as uploads, sales, and deletions. The ID can’t change, but the content itself isn’t stored on the blockchain, so you can be able to remove it.&#x20;

## Removing Content

You can take content down from your gallery anytime as long as you still own it. Once someone else buys your content, you can’t remove it from your gallery

## Content vs Account Deletion

* **Content Transfer:** If you choose to close your account, any of your content owned by other users will be transferred to their galleries.
  * Content owned by you will be removed
* **Account Deletion:** To delete your account, there’s a 48-hour waiting period. After this time, you’ll need to confirm that you want to proceed with deletion.  People who own your content will be notified about the upcoming account deletion.
* **Recent Purchases:** If someone bought your NFT within 48 hours of you starting the account deletion process, they can get a full refund, and the NFT will be returned to you. If you then confirm the deletion, such content will be removed from the platform.

## Keeping Track of Changes

Even if you remove content, all the actions taken with your NFT-like uploads, sales, or deletions will stay recorded on the blockchain.

**AI Personas as NFTs**

In addition to regular content, AI personas - except for personal digital twins - can be minted as unique NFTs. These identity-based NFTs can be owned, licensed, or traded, and contain metadata that captures personality settings, training history, and visual configurations. This ensures verifiable ownership of virtual characters and enables new forms of monetizable artistic expressions

## Additional Notes

* Account deletion **will not remove memes, emojis, or sound clips** added to the public Mesi Media Library. If the license for using them was paid, it will be converted to free access.
* **Music tracks** added to the open media library will be removed. However, content created by other users that incorporates these tracks will remain unaffected.
* If the NFTs you sold were generating **ad revenue**, you will no longer receive that income. That revenue stream will be fully transferred to the current owner of the NFT.
