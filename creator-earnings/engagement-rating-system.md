# Engagement Rating System

The Engagement Rating System measures an NFT or gallery's ability to drive desired activity on the Mesi Platform and the value users bring to the app.  It drives **fair rewards & revenue distribution among the galleries and NFTs**.\
\
Please note that Engagement Ratings and [Valuation Mechanics](nft-value-and-price.md) are independent but may share overlapping variables.

## How Engagement Rating Works

Each day, the system assigns points based on measurable activities and behaviors associated with individual NFTs or galleries, such as:

* **Viewing Time:** How long users spend viewing the content.
* **Interactions:** Likes, shares, comments, and other engagement metrics.
* **Spending Behavior:** Purchases or tips associated with the content.
* **Influence Points:** Owned or received points via delegation.
* **Community and Social Metrics:** Contributions to the broader Mesi ecosystem.

These ratings are internal backend metrics and are not visible to Mesi App users. They directly influence revenue and reward allocation for galleries and NFTs.

## Types of Engagement Ratings

#### 1. User Score

The **User Score** evaluates individual user activity and engagement within the app. It distinguishes between low-value and high-value users based on variables such as:

* The value of NFTs held by the user.
* Amount of staked or locked Mesi tokens.
* Other relevant behaviors and metrics.

**Example:**

**John:** A high-value user who spends significant time viewing content, interacts frequently, spends on NFTs, and holds a large amount of staked tokens. John receives **200 Engagement Rating points**, reflecting his active engagement and investment.\
\
**Paul:** A low-value user who occasionally views content, rarely interacts, and holds minimal tokens. Paul's score is significantly lower - he receives **5 Engagement Rating points**.

#### 2. NFT Score

The **NFT Score** measures the activity an individual NFT attracts, weighted by the User Scores of those interacting with it.

**Example:** Alice has an NFT in her gallery. John spends 2 minutes viewing it, and Paul spends 20 minutes. Assuming 1 point per minute:

* John’s engagement contributes 400 points (2 minutes × 200 User Score).
* Paul’s engagement contributes 100 points (20 minutes × 5 User Score).

The total NFT Score is **500 points.**

#### 3. Gallery score

The **Gallery Score** is the sum of:

* Total scores of all NFTs within the gallery.
* Activity generated by the gallery as a whole (not individual NFTs) is weighted by the User Scores of those interacting with it.

**Example**: Alice’s gallery contains several NFTs, with interactions from John and Paul:

* John spends 2 minutes viewing one NFT and 5 minutes browsing the gallery, bio, and profile details.
* Paul spends 20, 10, 5, and 1 minute on different NFTs.

**Calculations:**

* Total NFT Scores: (2 × 200) + (20 + 10 + 5 + 1 × 5) = 580 points.
* Gallery Activity Score: 5 minutes × 200 = 1,000 points.

Total Gallery Score: **1,580 points**.
