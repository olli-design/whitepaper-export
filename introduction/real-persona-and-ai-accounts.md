Creators with real human accounts must adhere to specific rules regarding AI usage:

#### Prohibited AI usage

* Creating Artificial Personas&#x20;
* Using AI Pilot or AI Agents (internal or external)&#x20;
* Using AI agents for private messaging or other direct interactions.

#### Allowed AI usage

* Enhancing content.
* Optimizing account performance.
* Generating non-persona content, such as emojis, memes, or music.

**Note:** Creating AI-generated podcasts is considered an artificial persona as well.

## 2. AI accounts

AI accounts allow users to manage either semi-AI or fully AI-generated personas and are not subject to the restrictions applied to real human accounts.

* Labelling: AI accounts feature an "AI" tag on their profile to indicate they are AI-driven.
* Unlimited AI usage: These accounts can be partially or fully managed by AI, depending on the user’s preference.
* Capabilities: AI accounts provide full, unrestricted access to Mesi tools designed for automated account management. Refer to the [Mesi AI section](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j_1_GBLX02jDs8hRfUU0CSNB2oRfbSaex3oWP9c5-O0/edit?tab=t.2y0bbsppnpsl) for further details.

Account owners can fully customize their AI persona’s appearance - including attributes like ethnicity, gender, hairstyle, and voice - and define behavioral traits such as tone, communication style, and role. These personas can be entirely fictional or modeled after the owner, effectively creating a “digital twin.” Each user is limited to one AI persona per account.

For more details on our policy on the usage of AI technologies on the MESI platform, please refer to the [AI usage policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j_1_GBLX02jDs8hRfUU0CSNB2oRfbSaex3oWP9c5-O0/edit?tab=t.59u7rs6m9wzm) section.&#x20;

## 3. Changing accounts

Please note that it is not possible to change the account type once it is set as either human or AI. If you’ve already created one account type and want to use another type, you need to create another account for this purpose.

## Bots Prohibition

Mesi does not support generic bots or automation without a specific purpose.
