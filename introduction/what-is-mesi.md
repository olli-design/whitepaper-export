# What is Mesi?

Mesi connects creators, influencers, artists, and performers with their fans through a novel **mutual monetization model**, allowing both sides (fans and creators) to participate in content monetization and rewards.\
\
The platform is accessible as both a **web app** and a **mobile app** (iOS and Android) and uses its blockchain - **Creator Chain** along with the **$MESI token**.

The more traffic (visits, comments, transactions, etc.) creators generate the higher their **Engagement Rating** and subsequently - rewards received. Fans can boost their favorite creators' popularity (and hence - earnings) using Influence Points earned by holding $MESI tokens.

With Mesi, creators can **sell their content**, enabling fans to trade and own pieces of their work. Owning specific content entitles fans to a share of its creator's gallery earnings and rewards

Unlike traditional platforms, Mesi allows **content trading**, meaning creators can put up their content for sale, owning a content piece entitles fans to participate in a portion of the creator’s gallery earnings and rewards (based on the engagement rating of that particular piece in the entire creator’s gallery).&#x20;

Creators can use features like **AI tools** for content creation and optimization, **micro-loans**, and **ad controls** to manage the frequency with which ads appear on their content.\
\
Mesi also lets creators promote their content and profiles **outside the app** using an **affiliate marketing network**. They can bid for global ad traffic and pay with fiat, USDC, or $MESI tokens. Affiliates go through a vetting process and are required to lock received payments as a guarantee. If they break advertising rules, their locked tokens may be penalized.<br>
