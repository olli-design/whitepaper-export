Mesi connects creators, influencers, artists, and performers with their fans through a novel **mutual monetization model**, allowing both sides to participate in content monetization and rewards.

The platform is accessible as both a **web app** and a **mobile app** (iOS and Android). It operates on its own blockchain, the **Creator Chain**, and utilizes the native **$MESI token**.

## Engagement and Rewards
The more traffic (visits, comments, transactions, etc.) creators generate, the higher their **Engagement Rating** and subsequent rewards. Fans can boost their favorite creators' popularity using **Influence Points** earned by holding $MESI tokens.

## Content Trading
Unlike traditional platforms, Mesi allows **content trading**:
* Creators can put up their content for sale.
* Owning a piece of content entitles fans to a portion of the creator’s gallery earnings.
* Rewards are calculated based on the engagement rating of that specific piece within the creator’s gallery.

## Creator Tools and Affiliate Network
Creators have access to **AI tools** for creation, **micro-loans**, and **ad controls** to manage frequency.

Mesi also enables promotion **outside the app** via an **affiliate marketing network**. Creators can bid for global traffic using fiat, USDC, or $MESI tokens. Affiliates are vetted and must lock payments as a guarantee; breaking rules results in token penalties.
