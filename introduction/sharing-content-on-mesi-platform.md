# Sharing content on Mesi platform

On Mesi, **everyone can share their content**. You can be a creator and a fan at the same time with just one account.&#x20;

When you upload content to Mesi, it **automatically turns into an NFT for free**. This is possible because of the [Creator Chain](../technology-and-backend/creator-chain-and-proof-of-stake-pos.md) - the blockchain technology behind the platform.

Mesi NFTs can **be bought, sold, and traded.** This creates a unique digital marketplace where everyone can take part and make money.&#x20;

## 7 content types

The Mesi platform lets you share seven different kinds of content:

* **Images:** Just like any pictures you’d share anywhere else.
* **Vibes:** Fun, short videos to share cool moments, creative ideas, or stories. Everyone on Mesi can see these.
* **Moments:** Quick photo or video updates that show highlights of your day. Only your fans can see these.
* **Music:** If you make music or are part of a record label, you can upload songs and albums to earn money. You can also use the Mesi Music Creator to produce and enhance your music with ease.&#x20;
* **Podcasts:** Share audio recordings about stories, interviews, lessons, or anything else you want to talk about. You can record, edit, and post episodes right on the platform.
* **Memes & Emojis:** Design your own funny memes or custom emojis.&#x20;
* **Sound Clips:** Short sound clips like beats, tunes, or fun noises.

## Collections

You can group your content into a collection that shows up as a separate section in your gallery (like "Top Picks from 2024"). Collections are a way to organize your work, but they aren’t NFTs or single pieces of content.

Key Points:

* One piece of content can be part of more than one collection.
* Collections make it easier for people to find and enjoy related content.

'Surprises are special content shown in your gallery with a ‘question mark’ icon. They can be public or just for your fans, depending on what you choose. To see a surprise, people have to meet certain conditions that you set.

Surprises can still be traded while they are locked. But if the new owner doesn’t meet the conditions, they won’t be able to open it.

Surprises are **only unlocked once**. After being opened, they’re no longer NFTs and can’t be traded anymore. They’ll stay in the 'unlocked surprises' section of the owner’s account.

## Task-Based Unlock Conditions

Here are some ways you can let people unlock your surprises:

* Assign a certain amount of influence points to your gallery.
* Make a payment.
* Subscribe to your account.
* Meet personal criteria, like age, location, or gender.
* A mix of the above.

## **Trigger-Based Unlock Conditions**

You can also set events or triggers for surprises to stay hidden until certain things happen. For example:

* **Future Date**: The surprise unlocks on a specific date, like one year later.
* **Follower Threshold**: It becomes available when you hit a certain number of followers (e.g., 1 million)&#x20;
* **Purchase Milestone**: It reveals itself when someone spends a set amount (e.g., $1,000)

You can adjust these conditions to fit your ideas.

## Flexible formats

Mesi supports both horizontal and vertical formats, unlike most platforms that only allow vertical. This gives creators more freedom in how they shoot and share content.
