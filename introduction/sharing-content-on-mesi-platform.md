On Mesi, **everyone can share their content**. You can be a creator and a fan at the same time with just one account.

When you upload content to Mesi, it **automatically turns into an NFT for free**. This is made possible by the [Creator Chain](/technology-and-backend/creator-chain-and-proof-of-stake-pos) — the blockchain technology powering the platform. Mesi NFTs can be bought, sold, and traded in a unique digital marketplace.

## 7 Content Types

The Mesi platform supports seven distinct content formats:

* **Images:** High-quality photos and digital art.
* **Vibes:** Public short-form videos for creative ideas and stories.
* **Moments:** Exclusive photo or video updates visible only to your fans.
* **Music:** Upload songs and albums or use the **Mesi Music Creator** to produce and enhance audio.
* **Podcasts:** Record, edit, and post audio episodes directly on the platform.
* **Memes & Emojis:** Custom funny memes or personalized emoji sets.
* **Sound Clips:** Short audio assets like beats, loops, or sound effects.

## Collections

Collections allow you to organize your work into specific categories (e.g., "Top Picks from 2024"). 

<Info>
  **Note:** Collections are organizational tools for your gallery; they are not NFTs themselves, though the content within them is.
</Info>

* One piece of content can belong to multiple collections.
* Collections improve discoverability for fans browsing your profile.

## Surprises

Surprises are special content pieces hidden behind a 'question mark' icon. They can be public or fan-exclusive. To reveal a surprise, users must meet specific conditions you define.

* **Trading:** Surprises can be traded while locked. However, the new owner must still meet the conditions to open it.
* **One-Time Unlock:** Once a surprise is opened, it is no longer an NFT and cannot be traded further. It remains in the owner's "unlocked surprises" section.

### Task-Based Conditions
You can require fans to complete specific actions:
* **Influence:** Assign a set amount of influence points to your gallery.
* **Payment:** Pay a specific price to unlock.
* **Subscription:** Require an active subscription to your profile.
* **Demographics:** Meet criteria such as age, location, or gender.

### Trigger-Based Conditions
Set "smart" triggers that reveal content automatically:
* **Future Date:** Unlock on a specific date (e.g., a "time capsule" post).
* **Follower Threshold:** Unlock when you reach a milestone (e.g., 1 million followers).
* **Spending Milestone:** Reveal when a user reaches a total spend limit (e.g., $1,000).

## Flexible Formats

Unlike many platforms that force a specific aspect ratio, Mesi supports both **horizontal and vertical** formats. This gives creators full artistic freedom over their cinematography and photography.
