## Integrating Blockchain into the Creator Economy

One of Mesi's primary goals is the comprehensive integration of blockchain technology with the creator economy. This encompasses the use of NFTs for establishing clear rules for content monetization and ownership transfers. Additionally, our focus extends to the utilization of a native token, enhancing the platform's functionality through tokenization.  This approach guarantees transparency and the permanence of records, spanning an array of activities such as transactions, deposits, withdrawals, and tipping.

## Facilitating Instant Transactions

By utilizing our native token for withdrawals, Mesi offers instant payouts. Users can claim Mesi tokens at any time, with immediate coverage from a treasury smart contract. These tokens can then be converted to other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, or fiat currencies using external platforms or Mesi's payment card.

## Tokenizing Interactions and Features

We are committed to enhancing the user experience and the quality of social platforms through the tokenization of interactions and features, employing both fungible tokens and NFTs. Consequently, most features of the Mesi app will be tokenized or linked to our native Mesi token in some way.

## Gamifying User Experience

We believe in making the user experience engaging and enjoyable. Therefore, all Mesi users, including creators and fans, will have opportunities to engage in competitive activities, strategize their interactions and behavior to gain better position and visibility within MESI ecosystem positioning and optimize their benefits.

## Focus on Innovation and AI

Innovation and AI are integral to our business strategy. Mesi is dedicated to incorporating the latest technological advancements, particularly generative AI, into our app, enhancing user engagement and content creation.

## Safeguarding Creators' Interests

The creator’s interests should be protected, and Mesi ensures that this is being done effectively. We ensure that whenever needed, fans need to go through the KYC process and that creators have control over the level of verification their fans must go through. They will even be able to request to know the identity of their fans first before allowing them to see the exclusive content they share. Our AI models will be also trained to detect potential content duplication and provide an extra layer of protection against copyright infringement within our platform.\
