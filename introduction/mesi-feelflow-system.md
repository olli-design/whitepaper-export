In simple words, FeelFlow lets you choose your **current mood** and the **target mood** you want. The system shows content that helps guide you from one to the other.

## **How it works**



1. **Current Mood** – The user selects (or the system detects) how they feel at the start.
2. **Target Mood** – The user picks the mood they want to reach.
3. **Transition Plan** – The system selects content that matches both the user's interests and this emotional journey.
4. **Live Adjustments** – The mood path adapts in real time based on user behavior like skips, pauses, or replays.<br>

## **Emotional Safety**

To protect users, the system includes psychological guardrails:

* No sharp mood changes (e.g., from sad to party)
* Smooth transitions only
* Context-aware adjustments (e.g., time of day, device type)<br>

## Mood Discovery Options

Users can:

* Select mood manually using emoji-based choices (e.g., 😄 Happy, 😢 Sad, 💧 Party)
* Let the system infer mood from behavior (e.g., scroll speed, pause time)
* Optionally add emoji moods to their profile to shape content passively<br>

This feature can be turned off anytime for a neutral browsing experience.
