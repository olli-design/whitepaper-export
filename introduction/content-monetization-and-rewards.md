The Mesi platform provides two primary financial incentives for participants:
1. **Direct Monetization:** Revenue generated from content access and sales.
2. **$MESI Rewards:** Passive incentives based on the performance of the content you own.

## Monetization Models

Mesi offers diverse revenue streams tailored to different user roles.

### For Creators
These options are available exclusively to the original content creators:
* **Licensing Fees:** Earn revenue when your content is used by others.
* **Surprise Unlocks:** Charge fees for fans to access "Surprise" content.
* **Subscriptions:** Offer tiered access to your fans for a recurring fee.
* **Bid-to-Meet:** Accept proposals for personal interactions or custom content.

### For Creators & Secondary Owners
These options are available to anyone who currently holds the content NFT:
* **NFT Secondary Sales:** Trade content on the marketplace for profit.
* **Ad Revenue:** Earn a share of revenue from the [Ads Engine](/advertising/ads-engine) linked directly to the NFT.

## $MESI Rewards

Every piece of content uploaded to Mesi generates **$MESI rewards** based on its engagement and traffic. 

* **How it works:** Rewards are calculated using the [Engagement Rating](/creator-earnings/engagement-rating-system). 
* **Ownership Benefit:** The current owner of the NFT (whether the creator or a fan who bought it) is entitled to these rewards.

## Licensing

Creators can expand their reach by submitting content to the **Mesi Public Content Library**.

### Public Library Submission
Once approved, your content becomes accessible for re-use by other platform users and external partners (e.g., adding your background music to their "Vibes" or "Moments").

* **Pricing Control:** Creators decide if their content is free to use or requires a licensing fee.
* **Creator Royalty:** Regardless of who owns the associated NFT, **all licensing fees are credited to the original creator.**
