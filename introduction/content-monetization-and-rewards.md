## Rewards

Every piece of content uploaded on the platform gets $MESI rewards depending on engagement and traffic it generates. For more details, check out the [Engagement Rating](../creator-earnings/engagement-rating-system.md) section.

## Licensing

Creators can submit their content for approval to be included in the Mesi platform’s **public content library.**&#x20;

Once approved, these items become accessible for re-use by all other platform users and external partners. Creators can choose whether their content will be free or require a fee for use.

Public content can be used in various ways, like **adding background music to the stories.**

Regardless of whether an associated NFT is sold, all licensing fees earned by it are credited to the original creator.

For more details, please refer to: [Licensing Rights](../other/licensing-rights.md) section.
