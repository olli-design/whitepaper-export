## Mesi for Music Artists

Mesi is an all-in-one platform for music creators to **distribute**, **advertise**, and **monetize** their music—both inside the Mesi app and across major external platforms.

Here’s how music artists can use Mesi:

* Upload existing songs or share never-before-heard tracks.
* Create new music using the Mesi Music Creator.
* Every uploaded track becomes an NFT by default, unlocking powerful monetization and engagement options.

### Tradable music NFTs

All tracks become tradable NFTs, offering two key ways to generate value:

* **Engagement Rewards** Music NFTs earn $Mesi token rewards based on how much fans interact with them. These rewards go to the current owner of the NFT.
* **Licensing Fees**: Uploaded tracks can be reused as background music or content. Artists choose whether to allow free access or charge a license fee- fees always go to the original creator, even after resale.
* **Secondary sales**: Creators or secondary owners can also sell their music NFTs at any time, transferring the right to earn engagement rewards to the new owner in exchange for additional revenue.&#x20;

### Licensing Fees (For Creator)&#x20;

As explained in the [Content Monetization & Rewards](https://mesi-1.gitbook.io/whitepaper/introduction/content-monetization-and-rewards), uploaded tracks can be used by others for creating content, like background music for stories.\
\
Music artists can decide if their tracks should be free (to increase engagement) or if they should have a licensing fee. The license fees always go to the original creator (even if the NFT is sold)

### One-click external distribution

To help artists maximize reach without added complexity, Mesi allows users to distribute tracks to major platforms beyond Mesi with one click. Mesi’s backend handles metadata, audio formatting, and revenue logistics.

### **Earnings & Payouts**

With a live dashboard, artists can easily monitor how their tracks are performing across platforms and see where their audience is most active.

Music earnings are paid out on a monthly basis - an exception to Mesi’s standard model, where most other earnings can be claimed instantly. Creators can choose to receive their payouts in USDC or $MESI. Those who select $MESI receive a 10% bonus, offering extra value for supporting the platform’s ecosystem.

Withdrawals are simple - funds can be sent directly to a linked bank account or used immediately through the Mesi debit card, giving artists quick and flexible access to their money.
