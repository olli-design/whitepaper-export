## Brand Accounts

Brand Accounts are verified profiles for organizations, studios, and agencies. They are designed for professional participation and advertising rather than individual content creation.

### Key Rules & Permissions
To maintain the platform's user-driven nature, Brand Accounts operate under specific constraints:
* **Verification:** Must pass a mandatory **Know-Your-Business (KYB)** process.
* **Advertising:** Full access to Mesi’s central ad engine to run global campaigns.
* **Engagement:** Can host quizzes, polls, and post official updates.
* **Exclusions:** Cannot receive engagement rewards, participate in Train2Earn, or upload personal/surprise content.

## Communities
**Tokenized thematic spaces for creators and fans.**

Communities on Mesi function similarly to Discord servers but are natively integrated into the blockchain. They allow users to gather around shared interests like *Lo-fi Beats*, *AI Art*, or *Underground Techno*.

* **Governance:** Admins can define flexible permissions and access thresholds (KYF).
* **Rich Interaction:** Dedicated timelines, featured content sections, and reward campaigns.
