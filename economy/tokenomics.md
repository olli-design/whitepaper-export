<Warning>
  **Note on Treasury:** While the Treasury is fully released at TGE, these tokens are non-circulating and are only deployed for critical ecosystem milestones and institutional partnerships.

<Tip>
  **Investor Insight:** The extended 12-month cliff for the Core Team and Advisors (accounting for 34% of supply) demonstrates a long-term commitment to the platform's success.
