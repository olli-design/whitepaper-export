## Mesi Fiscal Policy

Mesi’s fiscal policy is built to keep the Mesi App growing stronger. Here’s how it works:

* **Liquidity Support:** Mesi will use its funds to facilitate the creation and increasing liquidity of the USDC / $MESI trading pair to make MESI tokens easier to trade.
* **Incentives Refresh:** Periodically update reward budgets to keep incentives attractive.
* **Anti-Inflation Measures:** Supporting long-term economic value of the Mesi ecosystem
* **Sustainable Economy:** Making sure rewards and spending don’t go over the yearly budget, which is based on how much money the company expects to make.
* **Gradual Reverse Migration:** Slowly shifting all tokens and trading from other blockchains like Ethereum to the Creator Chain. This helps keep everything organized and focused on one system. The goal is to make liquidity even deeper and use the Creator Chain as the primary blockchain for Mesi tokens.
