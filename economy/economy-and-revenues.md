## Mesi Fiscal Policy

Our fiscal policy is engineered to maintain token stability and platform longevity through disciplined treasury management.

### Liquidity & Value Support
* **USDC / $MESI Depth:** Mesi actively utilizes treasury funds to bootstrap and deepen liquidity for the primary $MESI trading pairs.
* **Anti-Inflationary Measures:** For specific promotional programs (like the Welcome Bonus), Mesi performs **token burns** from reserves to offset supply entries.

### Sustainable Incentives
* **Budget Alignment:** Yearly reward budgets are capped based on projected platform earnings to prevent over-inflation.
* **Periodic Refreshes:** Incentive structures are audited and updated to remain competitive with market conditions.

### Migration & Chain Integrity
* **Consolidated Liquidity:** Mesi facilitates a gradual "Reverse Migration," moving liquidity from Ethereum to the **Creator Chain**. This focuses the ecosystem's economic power on our native infrastructure, ensuring faster settlements and lower fees.

<Tip>
  **Economic Transparency:** All platform fees and reward distributions are recorded on the Creator Chain, providing a verifiable "Source of Truth" for the Mesi economy.
