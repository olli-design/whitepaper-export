Mesi utilizes the **Welcome Bonus** program to drive ecosystem growth. These promotional tokens allow new users to explore premium features, tip creators, and upgrade account tiers without an immediate upfront investment in $MESI.

## Utility and Purpose

Welcome Bonus tokens are **off-chain** assets that mirror the utility of $MESI within the app. By separating them at the backend level, Mesi ensures these promotional incentives remain traceable and secure.

Users can utilize their Welcome Bonus for:
* **Creator Support:** Sending tips and making payments to their favorite creators.
* **Premium Access:** Unlocking exclusive content and advanced app features.
* **Account Upgrades:** Lowering the barrier for creators to reach higher monetization tiers.

## Withdrawal and Conversion

For eligible creators, Welcome Bonus tokens eventually transition into liquid $MESI. This process is governed by a long-term vesting period to ensure market stability.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Receipt of Bonus">
    Creator receives Welcome Bonus tokens from a fan for content or services.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Vesting Period">
    Tokens are subject to a **365-day holding period** from the moment they first entered circulation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Conversion & Withdrawal">
    After 365 days, the creator can withdraw these as standard, on-chain $MESI tokens.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reserve Burn">
    To prevent inflation, Mesi **burns** an equivalent amount of $MESI from its internal reserves for every Welcome Bonus withdrawal processed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Pro-Tip for New Creators:** Use your initial Welcome Bonus to experiment with premium promotional tools. This builds your engagement score, which is a prerequisite for withdrawing bonus payments in the future.
