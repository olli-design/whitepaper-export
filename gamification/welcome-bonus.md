# Welcome Bonus

Mesi plans to run campaigns offering free $MESI tokens to new accounts, referred to as the "Welcome Bonus." These bonuses are designed to help users quickly get started and explore the Mesi ecosystem before purchasing their first $MESI tokens.

## Overview

* The tokens from the Welcome Bonus are intended to:
* Promote app usage.
  * Provide token-based discounts for fans.
  * Help creators upgrade their accounts more easily.'
* They are off-chain tokens,  'acting as' MESI tokens, yet they are separated from them at a backend level, so they could be traceable.

## Purpose

* Payments to creators.
* Accessing premium features.
* Other payments

## Payments to Creators

## Withdrawal Rules

* Eligible creators can withdraw Welcome Bonus tokens as standard $MESI tokens
* Withdrawals are permitted 365 days after the Welcome Bonus tokens first enter circulation (i.e., are received by an eligible user).
* To ensure the supply does not exceed the maximum limit, MESI tokens used to cover the withdrawal of Welcome Bonus tokens will be burned from Mesi reserves.&#x20;
