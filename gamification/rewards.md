# Rewards

## Indirect rewards

Mesi in general doesn't provide direct $MESI token rewards just for holding a certain average balance or locking them as a creator. Such a system often leads to increased sell pressure over time, hurting the token’s value.

Instead, higher average balances and token lockups are rewarded through an **indirect approach** - please see below:

## Active user bonus

This is the only exception to Mesi’s indirect rewards policy. It is designed to promote active engagement rather than passive holding.&#x20;

Active user bonus incentivizes users to allocate influence points and decide which creators deserve greater support and visibility.&#x20;

All users who allocate their points, periodically share the pool of $MESI rewards (proportionally to the amount of allocated points they have to all allocated points within the Mesi platform).&#x20;

**Note**: the exact amount of $MESI rewards designated to active user bonuses and the frequency of its distribution is at Mesi's discretion.&#x20;
