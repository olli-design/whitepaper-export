## Program Availability

The Referral Program is a strategic initiative funded by a dedicated Mesi Treasury budget.

<Card title="Current Status: Active" icon="circle-check" iconType="solid" color="#10b981">
  The program remains active until the allocated budget is depleted. Mesi reserves the right to adjust bonus mechanics, total budget, or program timelines at its discretion to ensure sustainable growth.
</Card>

<Warning>
  **Valid Referrals Only:** Bonuses are only issued for "Valid Referrals." To prevent botting and fraud, Mesi's internal security systems must verify the new user's activity before bonuses are finalized.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  **Maximize Your Earnings:** Before launching a major referral campaign (e.g., on YouTube or TikTok), consider [Upgrading your Tier](/gamification/user-tiers-and-creator-limits). Referring 10 users at Tier 5 earns you **15x** more than at Tier 1.
