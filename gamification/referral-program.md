The Mesi Referral Program turns your network into a recurring asset. Once you reach **Tier 1**, you unlock a unique referral link and code, allowing you to earn $MESI bonuses for every valid user you onboard.

## Tier-Based Multipliers

While every Tier 1 user is eligible for a **Base Bonus**, the Mesi economy is designed to reward those with more "skin in the game." As you climb the creator tiers, your referral payouts experience a massive multiplier effect.



| Your Account Tier | Bonus Level | Estimated Value (in $MESI) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1** | Base Bonus | $10 |
| **Tier 2** | 2x Multiplier | $20 |
| **Tier 3** | 5x Multiplier | $50 |
| **Tier 4** | 10x Multiplier | $100 |
| **Tier 5** | **15x Multiplier** | **$150** |

## How It Works

Earning referral rewards is a simple three-step process integrated directly into your dashboard.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Unlock your Link">
    Reach **Tier 1** by maintaining the required holding score or locking tokens. Navigate to your profile settings to find your unique referral link.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share with your Network">
    Distribute your link via social media, private messages, or your external website.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Collect your Bonus">
    When a referred user completes a "Valid Action" (such as reaching Tier 1 themselves), the $MESI bonus is automatically credited to your wallet.
  </Step>
</Steps>
