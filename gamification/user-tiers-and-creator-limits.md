# User tiers & creator limits

## Two Progression Systems

Mesi introduces two progression systems

* **Content Monetization Limits**: The amounts of $MESI tokens required to unlock content monetization features and increase sales limits.
* **User Tiers**: The amount of [influence points](influence-points.md) required to unlock and increase the size of benefits available for all users.  They are assigned to every user, regardless of fans or creators.  They are earned through:
  * Holding mesi tokens and getting a **holding score**
  * Locking $MESI tokens as part of unlocking and increasing monetization limits.

For a complete overview of user tiers and content monetization limits, see the [Incentives & Limits](tier-breakdown.md) section.

## Holding score

The holding score is the average $MESI token balance in the user's wallet over the past 7 days.

**Example**: Mark's $MESI token balance in his Mesi wallet over the last 7 days:

* Days 1-5: **25,000**
* Day 6: **10,000**
* Day 7: **50,000**

His holding score is **26,429**

Every wallet balance change is taken into consideration in the calculation of the holding score. Since Mesi uses its native chain, it doesn’t require any snapshot-based system and can monitor these changes in real-time.

## Lockups

To lock $MESI tokens,  users just need to set a token withdrawal limit in their profile settings.&#x20;

This can be done at any time, even if their wallet balance is zero; however, a specific account tier is unlocked only when they start holding the required amount of tokens in their wallet.

#### Increasing Withdrawal Limit

Creators can increase their withdrawal limit to any amount, even beyond what’s required for the highest tier. This may be beneficial to maximize rewards or improve their engagement score.

#### Decreasing Withdrawal Limit

If a creator wants to decrease their withdrawal limit and regain the ability to transact or transfer tokens above that limit, they must adjust their account setup. This includes aligning their active sales, listed NFTs, and other tier-based settings with the tier they would qualify for after the withdrawal.

**Example**: A creator holding **5,000** $MESI tokens has a withdrawal limit set at **4,500** tokens.

If they wish to lower their limit to 2,500 tokens, they must adjust their account by reducing active sales volume and NFT listings to match the requirements of the lower tier.

Once their account aligns with the new tier, the withdrawal limit can be decreased, and they regain flexibility over the tokens above the new threshold.

While tokens stay in users’ wallets, they **can’t be spent or transferred** below the locked threshold. This system provides several key benefits:

* **Authenticity** – Creators must maintain a minimum $MESI balance, proving credibility. Fake accounts are unlikely to lock tokens.
* **Collateral** – Locked tokens act as collateral against policy violations or misuse, ensuring compensation for fans, other creators, and 3rd parties when justified.
* **Responsibility** – Higher sales limits require more tokens locked. With more at stake, users are less likely to break Mesi’s rules, promoting responsible monetization.

**NOTES**: Locking $MESI is not required to publish content - only to monetize it.

## Non-Custodial Approach

As explained above, you don’t need to transfer your tokens anywhere to increase holding scores or the $MESI token lockup size. They will remain in your wallet.&#x20;

This approach is referred to as ‘**non-custodial** ', and sets Mesi apart from other platforms that require transferring tokens to separate staking or lockup vaults, taking away the user’s control and ownership over the tokens.&#x20;

### Lockups vs AI Persona Enhancements

Locking $MESI tokens doesn’t just unlock monetization tiers - it also improves the quality and capabilities of your AI persona. Higher tiers grant access to advanced features such as emotional range, deeper conversation logic, and enhanced visual fidelity. The more tokens you lock, the more intelligent, expressive, and realistic your AI companion becomes.
