The Mesi App features three leaderboards:

* **Gallery of the Month**
* **NFT of the Month**
* **Creator of the Month**

Each leaderboard is based on [Engagement Ratings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j_1_GBLX02jDs8hRfUU0CSNB2oRfbSaex3oWP9c5-O0/edit?tab=t.1pfxd3n7x0cd) (Gallery score, NFT score, or User score). Since Engagement Rating values aren’t visible to users, the leaderboard displays only positions.

## Mechanics

* **Daily Snapshots**: Engagement Ratings are recorded at random times each day.
* **Ranking:** Positions are determined by the average of all daily snapshots taken during the competition period.

## **Rewards**

The top 3 in each leaderboard receive rewards, which may include:

* $MESI tokens
* Free, limited access to premium features
* Temporary account tier upgrades
* Premium positioning on the website
* Other exclusive benefits
