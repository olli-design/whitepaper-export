Leaderboards are the competitive heart of Mesi, celebrating the platform's most influential creators and assets. Rankings are driven by our proprietary [Engagement Rating System](/path-to-engagement), turning community interaction into tangible rewards and prestige.

    Recognizes the most active and supported collections based on **Gallery Score**.
  </Card>
  <Card title="NFT of the Month" icon="gem">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

To ensure fairness and prevent "last-minute gaming" of the system, Mesi uses a randomized snapshot methodology.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Daily Snapshots">
    The platform records Engagement Ratings at multiple random intervals throughout the day.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Average Calculation">
    Your daily rank is determined by the average of these snapshots, rather than a single point-in-time value.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly Aggregation">
    Final winners are decided by the average position maintained over the entire competition month.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Privacy Note:** To protect the integrity of the algorithm, exact Engagement Rating values are hidden. Only your current position and movement on the leaderboard are visible.
</Note>
