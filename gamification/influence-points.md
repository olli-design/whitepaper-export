# Influence points

Influence points are used to provide means for users to support their favorite creators. They are calculated by combining&#x20;

* **Mesi holding score** (7-day average $MESI balance of the user’s wallet)
* **Amount of  $MESI tokens locked**  (required to unlock content monetization and increase its limits)&#x20;

Users can assign these points to any gallery, boosting its engagement and showing support for a specific creator.

## Allocation and Adjustments

* Influence points can be freely allocated, reallocated, or withdrawn at any time.
* Their total changes whenever the user’s holding score or locked $MESI amount shifts.
* Allocations to specific creators adjust proportionally when the total amount of user influence points goes up or down.

**Example**: If you have **10,000 influence points** – with **4,000 assigned to one gallery** and **6,000 to another** - and your total drops to **5,000**, each gallery’s allocation is proportionally reduced to **2,000** and **3,000**, respectively.
