**Influence Points** represent a user's "voting power" or "support weight" within the Mesi ecosystem. Unlike traditional social media likes, Influence Points are backed by a user's financial commitment to the platform. By allocating these points to a creator's gallery, fans directly boost that creator's [Engagement Rating](/path-to-engagement) and monetization potential.

## How Influence Points are Calculated

Your total Influence Points are a dynamic reflection of your platform stake. The system automatically combines your passive holdings with your active commitments.



$$Total\ Influence\ Points = \text{Holding Score} + \text{Locked \$MESI Amount}$$

* **Holding Score:** The 7-day rolling average of $MESI tokens in your wallet.
* **Locked Amount:** The amount of tokens you have committed to [Monetization Tiers](/gamification/user-tiers-and-creator-limits).

## Allocation and Adjustments

Fans have total control over where their influence goes. You can support a single rising star or distribute your points across an entire portfolio of creators.

### Proportional Scaling Example
The system maintains your intended "support ratio" even as your token balance fluctuates.

> **Scenario:**
> You have **10,000 Influence Points** allocated as follows:
> * **Gallery A:** 4,000 points (40%)
> * **Gallery B:** 6,000 points (60%)
>
> If you sell tokens and your total points drop to **5,000**, the system maintains your 40/60 split:
> * **Gallery A:** Automatically reduced to **2,000**
> * **Gallery B:** Automatically reduced to **3,000**

When you assign influence points to a gallery:
1. **Boosts Engagement:** It increases the creator's [Gallery Score](/path-to-engagement), making their content more likely to appear in trending feeds.
2. **Increases Rewards:** A higher Gallery Score leads to a larger share of the [Weekly Engagement Rewards](/path-to-rewards).
