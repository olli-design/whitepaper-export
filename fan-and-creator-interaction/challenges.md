# Challenges

Mesi introduces a new way for creators to monetize their fan engagement through Challenges -  purpose-driven micro-fundraisers that blend spontaneous dares with escrow-backed tipping.

This feature is designed for simplicity, excitement, and accountability - replacing rigid crowdfunding mechanics with interactive “If X, then Y” challenges that work in both static and live-stream formats.

## How It Works

Creators launch a **Challenge** - a public commitment to do something specific, if a target amount of **purpose-tagged tips** (called bid-tips) is reached.

Example:

“If I raise 1,000 USDC, I’ll make a new song for my followers by 01.02.2026.”

Fans tip toward the goal. If the funding target is reached within the deadline, the creator either delivers the promise or refunds are issued based on clear conditions.

## Challenge Completion & Payout Logic

There are three possible outcomes for a Challenge:

### 1. Target Met – Creator Delivers

* Creator has defined the time window in which the challenge will be completed after fundraise target is hit, or fundraise deadline crossed (max 30 days)&#x20;
* Once the challenge is completed, they must click “Mark Challenge as Completed.”
* A 24h dispute window opens - anyone who tipped the minimum threshold can file a complaint if the promised content was not delivered as described.
* If no valid complaints are submitted, funds are released.
* If a complaint is filed, Mesi moderators pause the payout and manually review.

### 2. Target Met – No Action by Creator

If the creator does not click “Completed” within the previously defined time window, the challenge is marked as expired, and all bid-tips are automatically refunded.

### 3. Target Not Met

Creators can choose whether to deliver the challenge anyway.

* If they accept, the same process as a fully funded challenge applies (see point 1).
* If they reject, all funds are refunded immediately.
* If they take no action within the previously defined time window, funds are automatically refunded.

## Additional notes

**Platform Fee**: Mesi charges a 10% commission on successfully completed challenges.\
If the challenge is funded in $MESI tokens, the fee is reduced to 5% as a token utility incentive.\
\
**Engagement Rewards**:

Users who participate in successfully completed challenges (as tippers) receive Engagement Score bonuses. **Note**: Only finalized challenges qualify - incomplete or refunded ones do not trigger score boosts, preventing abuse.\
\
**Funding Currencies**:\
Challenges can be funded in USDC or $MESI tokens, depending on the creator’s settings.\
\
**Challenge Caps & Limits**:

* **The fundraising goal** is set by the creator.
* **The maximum goal** is linked to the creator’s account tier and monetization limits.
* **Minimum contribution**: $1 (in either USDC or MESI).
* **Timeframe**: Each challenge can run for a maximum of 7 days.
