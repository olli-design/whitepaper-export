Mesi provides a suite of dynamic tools that allow creators to pivot instantly between public broadcasting and high-value private interactions.

## Live Stream Modes

Creators can host video or audio streams in four distinct formats to suit their community and monetization goals.

## Tipping System

The tipping system is the heartbeat of Mesi's instant monetization. Fans can send support at any time across various interfaces.

### Features & Availability
* **No Upper Limit:** There are no maximum caps on tip sizes.
* **Integrated Access:** Tipping buttons are available on profiles, inside the Messenger, and within every Live Stream window.
* **Tipping URLs:** Creators can generate unique links to share on external social media to drive tips directly to their Mesi profile.

<Warning>
  **Currency Conversion:** While fans can tip in fiat or stablecoins, all non-$MESI tips are automatically converted and credited to the creator's balance in **$MESI tokens**.
</Warning>

## Messenger & Communication

Mesi’s Messenger provides a familiar, high-performance chat experience similar to major global messaging apps, but with native Web3 integrations.

## Safety & Moderation

We provide creators with the tools to maintain a safe environment while protecting fan rights.

* **Creator Controls:** Instantly block users or restrict messaging permissions based on user behavior or account status.
* **Escrow Protection:** To ensure fairness, fans can report instances of "unjust blocking" (e.g., being blocked immediately after a paid interaction). These reports are audited by Mesi to maintain platform integrity.
