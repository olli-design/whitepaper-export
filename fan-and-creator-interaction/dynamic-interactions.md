## Live Streams

You host live video or audio streams on the Mesi platform in four different ways:

#### Public session:

* The Mesi platform has a **section** where you can find **all the public streams** currently happening.
* **Anyone** with a Mesi account can join these streams, and there’s no time limit unless the streamer sets one.

#### Private Session:

* Private streams can **only be joined by subscribers, followers,** or people with a **special invite link** from the streamer.
* Streamers can set specific **rules** for who can join, like having a certain subscription level or donating a set amount of tips.

#### One-2-One Mode:

* During a stream (either public or private), streamers can switch to a one-to-one session with a **single viewer.**
  * Viewers can request this by giving a big tip or meeting the conditions set by the streamer.
  * Streamers can also mention the required tip amount in the stream description to make it clear.
* Streamer sets the time limit of One-on-one sessions - **from 5 to 30 minutes**.
* Both the streamer and the viewer can see and hear each other in a private video call.
* The streamer stays listed as active, so others know they are still live.
* Viewers see a message saying the streamer is in a one-to-one session, with an estimated time for when it will end.

#### Paid Session

* While streaming, streamers can limit access to users holding “**tickets**.”
* Tickets are sold during the stream in limited quantities at a **price** set by the streamer.
* Streamers can switch to "ticket-only" mode at any time, once confirmed, **non-ticket holders are removed** from the session.

**Note:** All live streams are subject to [KYF (Know Your Fan) policies.](know-your-fans-kyf-policy.md)

## Tipping System

The tipping system allows users to send tips to each other at any time.

Tips can be sent in fiat currency, stablecoins, or $MESI tokens (available exclusively through the web app). For creators, if a tip is deposited in fiat or any cryptocurrency other than $MESI, the final amount received is converted into $MESI tokens.

#### Tipping features:

* **No Upper Limit:** There is no maximum limit on the size of tips
* **Tipping buttons** are available on:
  * Creator's profile
  * Messenger
  * Live stream window
* Creators can generate **tipping URLs** inviting anyone to access their profile and make a tip.

## Messenger

Mesi’s Messenger is a communication tool, designed to mimic the functionalities of well-known and widely used apps like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Telegram, and others.&#x20;

## Creator moderation and user rights
