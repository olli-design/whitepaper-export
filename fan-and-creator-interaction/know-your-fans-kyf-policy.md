title: "Know Your Fans (KYF) Policy"
description: "Empowering creators with customizable data-sharing requirements to ensure community safety and compliance."

The **Know Your Fans (KYF)** policy is a unique security framework that allows creators to define exactly who can interact with their content. By leveraging the platform's verified KYC data, creators can request specific fan information before granting access to subscriptions, live streams, or private messaging.



## Core Concept
The KYF policy is **flexible and creator-driven**. You decide the barrier to entry based on the sensitivity of your content or the nature of the interaction. 

### Data Request Levels
Creators can choose from three standardized levels of information sharing:

| Level | Requested Data Points | Use Case Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Level 1** | Name, Age, Gender | General audience filtering |
| **Level 2** | Country / Location | Regional compliance or local meetups |
| **Level 3** | Verified Facial Photo | High-security or 1-on-1 interactions |

## How It Works

The KYF process is built on the principle of **Informed Consent**. Information is never shared with a creator without the fan's explicit approval.

<Steps>
  <Step title="The Request">
    When a fan attempts to access gated content (e.g., a Level 3 stream), they receive a prompt outlining the creator's KYF requirements.
  </Step>
  <Step title="KYC Verification Check">
    Mesi checks if the fan has already verified this data at the platform level (KYC). If the fan's KYC level is lower than the requested KYF level, they must upgrade their profile first.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Consent">
    The fan agrees to share the verified data points with that specific creator. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Granted">
    Once consent is given, Mesi securely transmits the verified data, and the creator (or their AI Agent) grants access to the content.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Privacy Guardrail:** Fans who have the highest level of platform KYC still must manually agree to every new creator's KYF request. Data is shared on a per-creator basis; it is never "open by default."
</Warning>

## Custom Rules & Exceptions

We recognize that one size does not fit all. Creators have full control over exceptions to their general policy:

* **Whitelist Exceptions:** Allow specific trusted accounts or long-term fans to skip general KYF rules.
* **Tiered Requirements:** Set lower KYF levels for public content and higher levels for "Surprises" or "Bid-to-Meet" interactions.
* **Manual Overrides:** Adjust rules for specific fans if you have already verified their identity through other professional means.

## Technical Integration
The KYF system is integrated into every monetization tool on Mesi:
* **Subscriptions:** Link tiers to specific KYF levels.
* **Live Streams:** Automatically boot or block users who don't meet the stream's KYF requirements.
* **Tipping:** Require identity verification before accepting large-scale tips to prevent money laundering or fraud.
