# Know Your Fans (KYF) Policy

Creators on the Mesi platform can set rules, called a **KYF policy**, to control who sees their content.

These rules let creators ask for certain information to be shared from KYC data that  fans have submitted while registration,  before they can subscribe, view pay-per-view content, join live streams, or even send tips. This helps make sure everything stays secure and personal.

## What Is the KYF Policy?

The KYF policy is **flexible**. Creators can decide what information fans need to provide for things like:

* Different subscription plans
* Special content like private photos or videos
* Any interaction where fan identity matters

## What Information Can Be Requested?

Creators can ask for fan information on three levels:

#### Level 1:

* Name
* Age
* Gender

#### Level 2:

* Country

#### Level 3:

* A photo of their face

## How Does It Work?

* Fans must agree to the KYF request; otherwise, their information will not be shared.
* If the KYF request level is higher than the user’s current KYC level, the user must upgrade their KYC level to accept the KYF request.
* Fans who already have the highest level of **KYC verification** don’t need to provide additional information. They only need to agree to the creator’s KYF request.
* Fans who haven’t met the required level will receive a prompt to update their information.

When a fan agrees to the KYF request, Mesi securely shares the verified information with the creator. The creator then decides if the fan can access their content.

## Special Rules for Exceptions

Creators can make **exceptions** to their KYF rules. For example, they can:

* Allow certain accounts to skip the general rules.
* Require less information from specific fans.

These options let creators make the rules fit their needs while still connecting with their fans in a way that feels right.
