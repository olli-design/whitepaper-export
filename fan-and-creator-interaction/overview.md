### Access-Based Interactions
Control your content's exclusivity and value through tiered access models:

* **Subscriptions:** Offer recurring monthly access to your inner circle for premium benefits.
* **Pay-Per-View (PPV):** Lock high-value individual posts or videos behind a one-time fee.
* **Surprises:** Create "mystery" content that remains tradable as an NFT until a fan meets your specific unlock conditions.

## High-Value Personal Interactions

For creators looking to offer deep, personal connections, Mesi facilitates secure real-world or 1-on-1 digital meetings.

### Bid-to-Meet (BtM)
The **Bid-to-Meet** system allows fans to bid for personal time with their favorite creators. This feature is designed for professional safety and financial security:

* **Escrow System:** Funds are held securely until the meeting is completed as agreed.
* **Integrated Calendar:** Fans can see your availability and bid for specific time slots.
* **Custom Verification:** Creators can require identity verification before accepting a bid.

<Note>
  Bid-to-Meet interactions are ideal for 1-on-1 coaching, VIP meet-and-greets, or commissioned performances.
