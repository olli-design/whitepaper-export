# Overview

## Two Types of Relations

On the Mesi platform, fans and creators connect in two main ways:

1. **Economic Interactions:** Involve NFT ownership, rewards, perks, and monetization; refer to the "[Galleries and NFTs"](../creator-earnings/galleries.md) section for detailed information.
2. **Social Interactions:** These focus on building relationships and engaging with each other through fun and interactive features.

## Social interaction types

#### Live Online Interactions

**Digital Live Streams:**

* Creators can go live with video or audio to talk with their fans in real time.
* Fans can join in, leave comments, and interact during the stream to stay connected.

**Tipping:**

Fans can send tips (fiat, stablecoins, MESI) to creators:

* During live streams.
* Through direct chat.
* Via the "Tip" button on the creator's profile.

**Messaging (Chat):**

* Creators and fans can chat using a built-in messenger that lets them stay connected, and build closer relationships through private messages.
* Creators can decide who can message them through chat. For example, allow only people who subscribe, send a certain amount of tips, or meet other rules the creator sets.

## Access-Based Interactions

* **Subscriptions:** Fans can subscribe to creators for exclusive access to content and benefits.
* **Pay-Per-View (PPV):** Specific content can be set as PPV, requiring fans to pay to view it.
* **Surprises:** Content can be turned into a surprise, which stays tradable until someone unlocks it. Fans can guess what’s inside based on hints from the creator, making the surprise more exciting and appealing to potential buyers.

## Live Personal Interactions

**Bid-to-Meet (BtM):** Allow fans to bid for personal meetings with creators, facilitated through an escrow system and an integrated calendar.
