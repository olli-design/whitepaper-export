Mesi allows creators to gate their content behind various access models, providing a steady stream of recurring revenue and one-time payments.

## Subscriptions

Creators can design multi-tiered subscription plans (e.g., Bronze, Silver, Gold) to offer fans tailored experiences and exclusive perks.

### Key Subscription Features
* **Tiered Discounts:** Automatically offer discounts on other content based on a fan's level (e.g., 50% off for "Gold" members).
* **Exclusive Access:** Gate private chats, high-definition streams, and "Surprise" content for subscribers only.
* **Free Trials:** Incentivize new sign-ups by offering free trials for up to **7 days**.

## Pay-Per-View (PPV)

PPV is ideal for high-value individual uploads, allowing you to charge a specific entry fee for premium content.

</div>

### How PPV Works
* **Unlock Once:** Fans pay the price set by the creator to permanently unlock the content for their account.
* **Secondary Sales:** If the NFT is sold to a new owner, that owner gains full access. However, users who previously paid to unlock the content **retain their access** regardless of who owns the NFT.
* **Price Control:** Creators can disable PPV requirements at any time. However, once an NFT is sold, a creator cannot *re-enable* PPV for that piece unless they repurchase it.

## Revenue Rights

<Tip>
  **The Creator Advantage:** On Mesi, **100% of PPV revenue** goes directly to the original creator, regardless of whether the NFT is currently owned by the creator or a fan.
</Tip>

This ensures that the creator continues to benefit from the viral success and continued consumption of their work long after the initial NFT sale.
