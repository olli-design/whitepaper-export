## Subscriptions

Creators can make different subscription plans for their fans, like Bronze, Silver, or Gold. Each plan gives fans different perks and costs different amounts.

#### Main Things About Subscriptions:

* **Price and Billing:** Creators choose how much the subscription costs and how often fans are charged (like every month or year).
* **What’s Included:** Creators can pick which NFTs fans get to see with each plan.
* **Extra Benefits:**
  * Discounts are based on fan levels (like 50% off for higher-level accounts).
  * Full access to extra features (like private chats or live streams).
  * Limited access to things like 100 private messages or 5 live streams.
* **Free Trial:** Fans can try the subscription free for up to 7 days.

## Pay-Per-View (PPV)

When creators upload content as NFTs, they can set it up as Pay-Per-View. This means fans have to pay to watch or see that content.

#### How PPV Works:

* **Pay to Watch:** Fans pay the price set by the creator to unlock the content. Once unlocked, it remains visible and accessible.&#x20;
* **If It’s Sold:** If the NFT is sold to someone else, the new owner also gets the PPV access.  Users who already unlocked the content are unaffected by ownership change.&#x20;
* **Creator Controls:**
  * Creators can turn off PPV at any time, even if the content has been sold to someone else.
  * Creators can’t turn on PPV for NFTs they’ve already sold unless they buy them back.

## Who Gets the Money?

All the money fans spend on PPV goes straight to the creator, even if the NFT is owned by someone else.
