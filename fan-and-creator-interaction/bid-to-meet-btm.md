# Bid-to-Meet (BtM)

**Bid-to-Meet (BtM)** is a concept that lets fans connect with creators using a safe and simple bidding process. It helps set up and manage personal meetings through the Mesi platform.

### How It Works

1. **Bidding Process:** Fans can place bids through a creator’s profile for a chance to meet them. The bid amount is stored safely in an escrow smart contract. (**Note**: Fans can only bid creators who allow this option.)
2. **Creator’s Acceptance:** The creator looks at the bids and, if they agree, a private chat opens so both sides can set up the meeting details (like time, place, or an online meeting platform).
3. **Escrow Management:** The bid money stays locked in the escrow until the meeting happens.
4. **Confirmation and Release:** During the meeting, the fan scans a QR code the creator gives them. This confirms the meeting happened and releases the funds from escrow to the creator.

## Additional features

* **Integrated Calendar:** Creators can use a built-in calendar to keep track of all their planned meetings and make sure they don’t miss anything.
* **KYF Policy:** Creators can require fans to accept a KYF (Know Your Fan) data-sharing request, which involves consent to access specific information about the bidder from the Mesi KYC form they've completed as part of account registration. (For more details, please see the [KYF section](know-your-fans-kyf-policy.md).) The KYF request is initiated after the creator approves the bid (step 2). If the bidder does not accept this requirement within 48 hours, the bid is canceled, and the funds held in the escrow contract are released back to the bidder.&#x20;

**AI-Powered Meetings**

For AI accounts, BtM offers virtual interactions with AI personas instead of real-life meetings. When a fan wins the bid, they gain access to a private virtual room where they can interact in real-time with the AI character.&#x20;

These sessions are powered by Mesi’s AI engine, and the personality, voice, and behavior of the AI can be enhanced through linked AI agents purchased by the account owner.

_**Note:** For AI accounts, bid-to-meet proposals function as virtual interaction offers rather than in-person meetings. AI creators can define tiered pricing levels for different formats, such as text chat, voice calls, or immersive video avatar sessions. These pricing tiers can vary depending on the account’s user tier and the complexity or upgrades applied to the AI persona._
