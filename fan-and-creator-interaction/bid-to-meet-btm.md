**Bid-to-Meet (BtM)** enables fans to bid for personal time with creators. The system uses smart contract escrow to ensure financial security and an integrated calendar to manage scheduling seamlessly.

## How It Works

The BtM process is designed to protect both parties, ensuring funds are only released upon a successful interaction.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Bidding">
    Fans place a bid via the creator's profile. The funds are immediately moved into a secure **Escrow Smart Contract**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Acceptance & Scheduling">
    If the creator accepts the bid, a private chat opens. Both parties use the **Integrated Calendar** to finalize the time, location, or digital platform.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Identity Verification">
    The creator may trigger a **KYF (Know Your Fan)** request. The fan must consent to share specific registration data within 48 hours, or the bid is automatically cancelled and refunded.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Meeting & QR Confirmation">
    During the meeting, the creator presents a unique **QR code**. Once the fan scans it, the meeting is verified, and the escrow funds are released to the creator.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Safety & Trust

<Warning>
  **KYF Compliance:** To ensure creator safety, bidders must have a completed KYC profile. If a creator requests KYF data and the bidder denies or ignores it, the interaction is terminated to prevent unauthorized or high-risk encounters.
</Warning>

### Integrated Calendar
Creators can manage their availability directly within the Mesi App. The calendar syncs with accepted bids to prevent double-booking and sends automated reminders to both parties.

## Virtual BtM (AI Accounts)

For **AI Accounts**, Bid-to-Meet transitions from physical meetings to immersive virtual interactions.

Instead of a physical location, winning bidders gain access to a **Private Virtual Room**. Here, they can interact in real-time with the AI persona.

* **Tiered Formats:** AI creators can set different pricing tiers for Text Chat, Voice Calls, or Full-Video Avatar sessions.
* **Agent Enhancements:** The quality of the interaction (voice realism, behavioral depth) depends on the AI Agents and upgrades the account owner has active.
* **Instant Delivery:** Unlike human meetings, AI virtual sessions can often be triggered immediately upon bid acceptance.

<Note>
  AI-Virtual meetings are a primary revenue stream for "Digital Twin" and fully synthetic personas, offering fans 1-on-1 time that scales without physical constraints.
